Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid),design-tools,5.6,figma-plugin,"When multiple designers collaborate or iterate on the same file, changes can override each other. Figma’s branching feature (for org accounts) addresses this, but many teams on lower plans lack a structured review for design changes. They often communicate via Slack or comments which can be messy. There’s no simple way to see what changed between two states of a design and approve merges (except manual comparison).","A plugin that emulates a “merge request” workflow for Figma designs. It could work by allowing a designer to mark a frame or page as a new version and compare it to an older snapshot (leveraging our earlier version snapshot logic from Project 12). It highlights differences and then could notify another user for review (maybe by generating a shareable summary of changes). While it can’t truly restrict merges without Figma’s branching, it offers structure: you can pseudo-“fork” (duplicate) a frame, modify it, then use the plugin to compare with original and if “approved”, replace the original with the new one. This facilitates a lightweight design review process.",Design teams without Figma Organization (which has native branching) or even those with it but wanting a simpler quick review for small changes. Also design leads who want to ensure changes are reviewed. It could also help in design handoff to devs by highlighting what changed since last version (so devs know what to update).,"This is more niche, probably a one-time or small subscription aimed at teams. Maybe charge per team usage (like $50 one-time for a team pack or $5/user). But given it’s essentially a process tool, adoption might be limited to serious collaborative teams. Let’s say one-time per user $10 and perhaps multi-user discounts.",400,"~7 days. Use design snapshot diff logic (from Project 12: Design Versioner) to show differences. Possibly integrate with some notification (like generate a markdown of changes that can be posted or copied to Slack). Actually notifying via plugin is hard unless we integrate with email/Slack API which would require user-provided webhook or minimal server involvement (maybe output text and user manually shares). Main heavy lifting: diffing two frames (which we've partly covered earlier). Also interface for “Propose change” and “Merge it” which essentially could mean copying changes over. If the frames are in same file, merging is basically replacing original content with new (we could copy over the changed layers). Or more simply, user manually merges after reviewing diff. We may not fully automate merge (to avoid messing up file). Could assist by selecting changed layers to quickly copy.","7/10 – Implementing a reliable diff for design layers is complex. Visual diff (like snapshot images pixel compare) could be easier but not precise for content changes. A simpler approach: traverse layer tree and find mismatches (text changed, layer moved by x px, color changed) and list them. That’s doable but needs careful recursion and tolerance for minor differences (like if a shadow changed or an auto-layout reflow slightly moved something). We can narrow to changes in properties we care about: position, size, fill, text content. It doesn’t have to catch every nuance (like if two icons swapped positions, though that would appear as two position changes). For merging, actually applying differences programmatically means we’d manipulate the original frame’s layers – possible but risk of messing up if structure diverged. Perhaps leave merge to user using our guidance. Focus on compare and summary.","Low – Figma’s own branching is the competition, but behind expensive plan. Some teams use abstracted process, but nothing direct in plugin form. So it’s somewhat unique. Main competitor is status quo (designers eyeballing differences or just trusting each other).",True,10
LayerSage (Auto-Organize & Name),design-tools,5.6,figma-plugin,"Large Figma files often get disorganized – layer names like “Rectangle 123” or random grouping, making it hard to navigate or hand off to others. Cleaning up layers by grouping logically and renaming (e.g. “Header/Bg”, “Button/Icon”) is tedious but important for team collaboration.",A plugin that uses smart rules to auto-organize the layers and structure. It can group layers that form a component (e.g. detect a rectangle and label text as a “button” group) and suggest meaningful names based on their content or design function (possibly using a bit of AI/NLP on the layer properties). It can also apply a consistent naming convention (like Title Case or slashes for hierarchy) across the fil 】. Think of it as a linter/formatter for Figma layers.,"Designers working in teams or handing files to developers, design ops people who maintain library hygiene, and anyone inheriting a messy file who wants to tidy it up quickly.","One-time purchase (~$15) or Freemium (basic grouping free, advanced AI naming in Pro). Probably one-time suits since it’s a utility used periodically. Teams might buy a few copies if they value cleanliness.",800,"~6 days. The logic includes: scanning layers for patterns (text above rectangle often = button), proximity-based grouping (elements that overlap to form a component), and making decisions on grouping. That can be rule-based initially. For naming, we could use some heuristics (if a text layer says “Login”, name group “Button/Login” etc.). Possibly call an AI for suggestion if content isn’t obvious (like a vector icon could be identified via an AI vision API to name it “Icon/Home” for a home icon). That’s a stretch goal. Without AI, we rely on layer type and styles to guess (“Layer with 8px stroke and no fill likely ‘Divider’ line”). AI assistance can help code but also maybe we can use an image recognition API for icons. Complexity moderate.","7/10 – Grouping layers programmatically without messing up constraints or component structures is tricky. We must ensure if we create a group, we don’t disrupt auto-layout or component definitions – maybe limit to frames where grouping won’t break layout. Or only rename and not group if auto-layout present. Renaming is easier (just changing name property). Using AI for icon naming means extracting image data and calling an API like Azure Vision or custom model, possible but adds to cost. We could stick to using existing layer name or library info (if an icon is from a known set, might already have a name). The complexity is mostly in not screwing up the file integrity while improving it.","Low – There are a few plugins like “Rename It” (for batch renaming with find/replace) and “AutoGrid” or “tidy up” features in Figma (just aligns). But no holistic solution that intelligently groups and names semantically. So mostly unique. However, some designers might be wary letting a plugin rearrange layers in case it breaks prototypes or constraints. So trust-building and maybe partial application (preview changes) is needed.",True,10
