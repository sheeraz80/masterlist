Stark (a plugin) does color contrast and color blindness simulation (they have a subscription model and have some traction, Night Eye etc for dark mode).

Collate color styles usage – maybe produce a list of all colors in use that aren’t in the official palette. These are all doable with the API. Packaging assets might mean triggering the built-in export for all marked layers and maybe zipping them – but without a server, maybe just instructing user to bulk export via Figma’s interface (the plugin can multi-select and export to local?). Might not handle zipping easily without a backend, but we can at least mark or highlight.

For RTL, we can apply a transform (Figma doesn’t have a global direction switch, but we can reverse order of text characters and perhaps align right). Mirroring layout is tricky – we might simply highlight that RTL would need rethinking; fully mirroring frame content might be beyond scope (maybe duplicate frame and swap positions of certain common patterns manually or via heuristic like reverse order of items in auto-layout frames if direction is horizontal).

While it can’t truly restrict merges without Figma’s branching, it offers structure: you can pseudo-“fork” (duplicate) a frame, modify it, then use the plugin to compare with original and if “approved”, replace the original with the new one.

To keep text editable, we’d have to parse Figma text layers and convert to PPTX text boxes – doable for simple text (font, size, color), though exact fidelity might suffer if Figma uses custom fonts (we can embed or require them). As a simpler route, we export all frames to images and put each as full-slide image in PPT – which is what many do manually. That loses editability but is safe. Perhaps offer choice: quick image slides vs. experimental editable export. AI assistance not needed, straightforward file assembly.",

    "solution": "An AI-powered plugin that analyzes a Figma frame or flow and provides suggestions or critiques. For example, it might flag if a button’s call-to-action text is ambiguous, or if an important element is too low contrast (beyond pure color contrast, maybe hierarchy). It could also suggest improvements like “Consider making this text larger for readability” or “This screen has many elements; consider simplifying.” The AI uses design best practices learned from large datasets to give written feedback, almost like a junior UX consultant inside Figma.",

AI assistance in coding would help format this prompt. Then parsing AI response and showing it nicely in plugin UI. The heavy lift (the “knowledge”) is on the AI’s side, so our job is prompt engineering and UI.",
    "competition_level": "Low – There are a couple of experimental plugins (e.g. Microsoft had a research project on AI design feedback, and there's “Magician” plugin for copy and small tasks).

      "Context selection: User can specify the type of app or user (like “This is a finance app for seniors”) to guide the AI’s critique focus. The plugin passes that context to the AI prompt for more tailored feedback (like accessibility for seniors, or security concerns for finance UI).",

Possibly call an AI for suggestion if content isn’t obvious (like a vector icon could be identified via an AI vision API to name it “Icon/Home” for a home icon). That’s a stretch goal.

Minor tasks (like “fix padding here” or “replace image”) may be noted in comments or separate tools and get lost. There’s no lightweight way in Figma to keep a checklist of design tweaks or tasks linked to the design itself.",
    "solution": "A Figma plugin that adds a simple to-do or task list panel within the Figma canvas. Designers can create tasks linked to specific frames or elements (e.g. “Revise header color on Screen 3”) and check them off as they work. It’s like sticky note to-dos inside Figma, eliminating the need to switch to an external tracker for small iterative tasks. Optionally, it can sync with popular tools (Trello, Jira) via their APIs if desired, but primarily it’s zero-backend (storing tasks in the Figma file or local storage).",
    "category": "Figma Plugin",
    "target_users": "In-house design teams and freelance designers collaborating with clients – anyone who wants to track design-specific tasks without heavy project management overhead. Especially useful for solo designers or small teams that find full Jira tickets overkill for minor design fixes.",
    "revenue_model": "Freemium. Free for individual use with basic checklist features. A paid version (perhaps $5/month per user or a one-time $25) adds integrations (sync tasks to external PM tools) and team collaboration (shared task lists for a Figma file that multiple editors can check off). Another angle: monetize through the Figma Community as a paid plugin once that’s open (or via our website with license keys).",

AI is not particularly needed here aside from maybe assisting code.",
    "competition_level": "Low – There isn’t a well-known Figma plugin for task management; most teams use external tools. Some plugins exist to send frames to Jira or GitHub, but nothing that acts as a simple internal checklist to our knowledge. The novelty is integrating tasks into the design context.

For example, it can ensure all icons/images intended for export are marked exportable at the right resolutions, all text styles and color styles are properly used (so devs can reference design tokens easily), and generate a quick summary of the spacing and dimensions of key elements. It might also allow adding annotations (like tooltips) that devs can read in the prototype. Essentially a “pre-flight” for design handoff.",

Check text layers to see if they use a text style – if some are manually overridden, flag them (so design system tokens aren’t broken). Collate color styles usage – maybe produce a list of all colors in use that aren’t in the official palette. These are all doable with the API. Packaging assets might mean triggering the built-in export for all marked layers and maybe zipping them – but without a server, maybe just instructing user to bulk export via Figma’s interface (the plugin can multi-select and export to local?). Might not handle zipping easily without a backend, but we can at least mark or highlight. Annotations could be just adding callout shapes or using comments (Figma comment via API not open to plugins I think). Possibly just highlight where designers should manually annotate. So mainly scanning and reporting.",
    "competition_level": "Low – Some teams use Zeplin or Storybook for organized handoff. But within Figma, not aware of a plugin that preflights.

      "Style consistency: List text that isn’t using a predefined text style (suggest to create one or use one) and colors not from color styles, because developers prefer consistent tokens.",
      "Spacing tokens: If the design system uses consistent spacings (like 8px increments), we can scan distances between elements – flag any odd spacing that’s off-grid (like 17px gap instead of 16px, which might be a mistake). This helps avoid weird values in code.",
      "Asset package (Pro): Let user select all export-marked assets and click “Export All Assets” to get a zip of them at correct resolutions naming appropriately (maybe pulling layer names). This saves time clicking each or using Figma’s export interface for multiple selections.",

For RTL, we can apply a transform (Figma doesn’t have a global direction switch, but we can reverse order of text characters and perhaps align right). Mirroring layout is tricky – we might simply highlight that RTL would need rethinking; fully mirroring frame content might be beyond scope (maybe duplicate frame and swap positions of certain common patterns manually or via heuristic like reverse order of items in auto-layout frames if direction is horizontal). Could partially support if frame uses auto-layout (we can set its direction property to reverse if plugin sees fit). Might limit initial RTL support to text alignment and reversing text only.",

    "title": "Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid)",
    "problem": "When multiple designers collaborate or iterate on the same file, changes can override each other. Figma’s branching feature (for org accounts) addresses this, but many teams on lower plans lack a structured review for design changes. They often communicate via Slack or comments which can be messy. There’s no simple way to see what changed between two states of a design and approve merges (except manual comparison).",
    "solution": "A plugin that emulates a “merge request” workflow for Figma designs. It could work by allowing a designer to mark a frame or page as a new version and compare it to an older snapshot (leveraging our earlier version snapshot logic from Project 12). It highlights differences and then could notify another user for review (maybe by generating a shareable summary of changes). While it can’t truly restrict merges without Figma’s branching, it offers structure: you can pseudo-“fork” (duplicate) a frame, modify it, then use the plugin to compare with original and if “approved”, replace the original with the new one. This facilitates a lightweight design review process.",
    "category": "Figma Plugin",
    "target_users": "Design teams without Figma Organization (which has native branching) or even those with it but wanting a simpler quick review for small changes. Also design leads who want to ensure changes are reviewed. It could also help in design handoff to devs by highlighting what changed since last version (so devs know what to update).",
    "revenue_model": "This is more niche, probably a one-time or small subscription aimed at teams. Maybe charge per team usage (like $50 one-time for a team pack or $5/user). But given it’s essentially a process tool, adoption might be limited to serious collaborative teams. Let’s say one-time per user $10 and perhaps multi-user discounts.",

Possibly integrate with some notification (like generate a markdown of changes that can be posted or copied to Slack). Actually notifying via plugin is hard unless we integrate with email/Slack API which would require user-provided webhook or minimal server involvement (maybe output text and user manually shares). Main heavy lifting: diffing two frames (which we've partly covered earlier). Also interface for “Propose change” and “Merge it” which essentially could mean copying changes over. If the frames are in same file, merging is basically replacing original content with new (we could copy over the changed layers). Or more simply, user manually merges after reviewing diff. We may not fully automate merge (to avoid messing up file). Could assist by selecting changed layers to quickly copy.",
    "competition_level": "Low – Figma’s own branching is the competition, but behind expensive plan. Some teams use abstracted process, but nothing direct in plugin form. So it’s somewhat unique. Main competitor is status quo (designers eyeballing differences or just trusting each other).",

    "key_features": [
      "Snapshot and compare: Designer takes a \"before\" snapshot of a frame (or uses a baseline). After making changes (maybe on a copy of that frame or same frame – if same frame, we need an earlier snapshot; if on copy, we can diff copy vs original). The plugin generates a list of differences: e.g. “Text ‘Signup’ changed to ‘Sign Up’”, “Button color #0088FF -> #0077Ee”, “Image layer added”, “Icon moved +10px right”. Possibly also highlight these changes on the canvas (like drawing boxes around changed elements).",
      "Share changes: Provide a text summary or simple visual diff output (maybe snapshot images of before/after with highlights) that can be pasted into Slack or attached to an email for review. If we can’t directly integrate, we can at least copy text to clipboard or export a .png showing changes.",
      "Approval tracking: Not easy without a server, but we could allow adding a checkmark or comment in the file that someone approved. Perhaps just instruct to resolve by merging. Possibly integrate with Figma comments by adding a comment listing changes (but comments via plugin might not be allowed). Maybe simplest: after review, user clicks “Apply changes” and plugin replaces the original frame’s content with new one. Or if working on same frame with snapshots, just finalize that snapshot as new baseline. We can simulate an approval by marking in plugin that it's merged (for our reference) but that doesn’t persist globally.",
      "Merge assistance: If the design iteration was done on a separate frame, the plugin can automatically replace the old frame with the new one (or copy changed layers over) when approved, to avoid manual copy-paste errors. Essentially a one-click update original."

Possibly call an AI for suggestion if content isn’t obvious (like a vector icon could be identified via an AI vision API to name it “Icon/Home” for a home icon). That’s a stretch goal.

Provide consistent prefixes for types (like “Btn_…”, “Icon/…”) according to a chosen convention.",
