      "revenue_potential": "Conservative: $500/month; Realistic: $1,500/month; Optimistic: $5,000/month. This assumes steady sales of ~25 to 250 copies monthly, which is feasible given Figma’s user base and the broad appeal of layout automation.",

Key tasks: measure current spacing/margins, detect patterns (like all items equally spaced but not using auto layout), then apply appropriate settings. Edge cases (nested auto layouts) require careful handling but are manageable. No external integrations required.",
      "competition_level": "Low – While many tutorials and some plugins exist to help with Auto Layout, there is no widely used “optimizer” tool. Figma’s own features are manual.

Iterate through text nodes and shapes, compute contrast ratios between foreground text and its background color (requires determining background, which can be tricky if layered – but we can simplify by using the immediate parent fill or artboard color). The math and rule definitions for WCAG 2.1 (contrast ratio 4.5:1 for normal text etc.) are well-defined. Everything runs client-side.",

Google’s API usage might need OAuth – which is tricky without a backend, but we can use the simpler approach: require the sheet to be published or use an API key restricted to that sheet. Alternatively, let users upload a CSV. The two-way sync (export text) involves iterating Figma nodes and generating CSV. All doable in plugin environment.",
      "competition_level": "Medium – There’s an official Google Sheets sync Figma plugin (from Figma/Google) that fills content from sheets. However, its functionality is somewhat basic. Our advantage can be two-way sync and more formats. Also, other plugins like “Content Reel” provide sample data but not real content sync.

To keep text editable, we’d have to parse Figma text layers and convert to PPTX text boxes – doable for simple text (font, size, color), though exact fidelity might suffer if Figma uses custom fonts (we can embed or require them). As a simpler route, we export all frames to images and put each as full-slide image in PPT – which is what many do manually. That loses editability but is safe. Perhaps offer choice: quick image slides vs. experimental editable export. AI assistance not needed, straightforward file assembly.",

Using AI for icon naming means extracting image data and calling an API like Azure Vision or custom model, possible but adds to cost.

Possibly minor math to place for angled templates (Angle plugin uses perspective transforms which Figma can’t natively do except via distort which is tricky; maybe we stick to flat front-facing for simplicity, or provide multiple pre-angled images and just place flat design and skew it visually – not perfect without actual transform).
