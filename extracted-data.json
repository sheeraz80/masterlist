The logic includes: scanning layers for patterns (text above rectangle often = button), proximity-based grouping (elements that overlap to form a component), and making decisions on grouping.

Possibly call an AI for suggestion if content isn’t obvious (like a vector icon could be identified via an AI vision API to name it “Icon/Home” for a home icon). That’s a stretch goal.

Pseudo-localization (e.g. adding accent marks to every vowel and lengthening by 30%) we can do offline. Replacing text nodes in Figma is straightforward. For RTL, we can apply a transform (Figma doesn’t have a global direction switch, but we can reverse order of text characters and perhaps align right). Mirroring layout is tricky – we might simply highlight that RTL would need rethinking; fully mirroring frame content might be beyond scope (maybe duplicate frame and swap positions of certain common patterns manually or via heuristic like reverse order of items in auto-layout frames if direction is horizontal). Could partially support if frame uses auto-layout (we can set its direction property to reverse if plugin sees fit). Might limit initial RTL support to text alignment and reversing text only.",

For RTL, we can apply a transform (Figma doesn’t have a global direction switch, but we can reverse order of text characters and perhaps align right). Mirroring layout is tricky – we might simply highlight that RTL would need rethinking; fully mirroring frame content might be beyond scope (maybe duplicate frame and swap positions of certain common patterns manually or via heuristic like reverse order of items in auto-layout frames if direction is horizontal).
