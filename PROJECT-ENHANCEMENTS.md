  progressRange: number[];
  status: string[];
  sortBy: string;
  sortOrder: 'asc' | 'desc';
}

// Project Metrics Interface
interface ProjectMetrics {
  totalProjects: number;
  avgQuality: number;
  totalRevenue: number;
  completionRate: number;
  trending: { category: string; growth: number }[];
  insights: string[];
}
```

### API Integration
- RESTful API endpoints for project operations
