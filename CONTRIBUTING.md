## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv, etc.)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests to verify setup
pytest

# Start development server
FLASK_ENV=development python web/app.py
```

### Development Tools

```bash
# Code formatting
black .

# Linting
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .

# Run all checks
make lint
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:
- Line length: 120 characters
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write comprehensive docstrings

#### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

def process_project_data(
    project_key: str,
    filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process project data with optional filters.
    
    Args:
        project_key: Unique project identifier
        filters: Optional filtering criteria
        
    Returns:
        Processed project data dictionary
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If project_key is invalid
    """
    if not project_key:
        raise ValueError("Project key cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    return processed_data
```

### Commit Messages

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_search.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_search.py::test_advanced_search
```

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class TestProjectSearch:
    @pytest.fixture
    def search_engine(self):
        return SearchEngine()
    
    def test_search_by_quality(self, search_engine):
        """Test searching projects by quality score."""
        results = search_engine.search(min_quality=8.0)
        
        assert len(results) > 0
        assert all(p['quality_score'] >= 8.0 for p in results)
    
    @patch('search.load_projects')
    def test_search_with_mock(self, mock_load):
        """Test search with mocked data."""
        mock_load.return_value = [
            {'name': 'Test Project', 'quality_score': 9.0}
        ]
        
        results = search_by_quality(8.0)
        assert len(results) == 1
```

### Test Coverage
