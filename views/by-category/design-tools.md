- **Platforms:** Jasper Canvas
- **Problem:** Creating visual content like explainer videos or ad campaigns requires a storyboard with both a visual description and a narrative script. Writing prompts for an AI image generator and writing the cor...
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10. A chained Jasper prompt where the user's story outline is first broken into scenes, then for each scene, two separate prompts are run: one to generate an image prompt, and one to generate the narrative text.

### [MicroAnimator (Interactive Exporter)](../../design-tools/microanimator-interactive-exporter/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Designing micro-interactions (small animations like button hover effects or loading spinners) in Figma is possible via Smart Animate, but exporting those animations for development (as GIFs or Lottie ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 7/10 – Capturing Figma designs into an animation is tricky. If using a frame sequence approach: user labels frames as steps, we capture each as an image and compile to GIF/MP4 (we’d likely use an offscreen canvas or ask user to download frames and use FFmpeg externally – but since zero-server, maybe pure JS GIF encoder). Lottie export requires mapping Figma shapes to Lottie format – very complex to do fully; perhaps focus on basic shape animations. We might initially limit to GIF/MP4 which are easier (though large frames might cause performance issues). Ensuring decent quality and performance is a challenge.

### [LayoutPlanner (Grid & Guide Assistant)](../../design-tools/layoutplanner-grid-guide-assistant/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Setting up consistent grids, columns, and guides in Figma is manual. Designers often eyeball spacing or copy guides from one page to another. Lack of proper grid alignment leads to misaligned elements...
- **Technical Complexity:** 2/10 – Very straightforward to apply grid settings via API (just copying an array of grid definitions). Calculating positions to check alignment requires basic math mod operations. Drawing lines for guides is simple shape creation. This is mostly a UI/UX design problem to present options nicely, technically not complex.

### [Bulk Style & Variable Replacer](../../design-tools/bulk-style-variable-replacer/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** When refactoring a design system or merging two files, designers often need to replace all instances of one color/text style with another. Figma's native "Select all with..." feature can be cumbersome...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. This requires a deep traversal of the document tree. The logic must identify every layer property (fills, strokes, effects, fonts) that uses the target style and then re-assign it to the replacement style. Handling edge cases and ensuring performance on large files is the main challenge.

### [Real-Time Stock Chart Generator](../../design-tools/real-time-stock-chart-generator/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $4,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Designers working on fintech or investment app UIs need to create realistic and visually appealing stock charts. Using static, fake data looks unprofessional, and creating accurate charts manually is ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. The plugin itself is a client for a third-party financial data API (e.g., Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, which have free tiers). The user provides their own API key. The plugin's job is to take a ticker symbol, fetch the data, and then use the Figma API to draw the chart using vector paths and shapes.

### [Dynamic Persona Generator](../../design-tools/dynamic-persona-generator/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,500/month

- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. The plugin would call two external APIs: an AI text generation API (like a free-tier OpenAI model) with a carefully crafted prompt to generate the persona data in JSON format, and an AI avatar generation API (like or a dedicated service). The user provides their own API keys.

### [Isometric Scene Builder](../../design-tools/isometric-scene-builder/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $4,500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Creating isometric illustrations in Figma is a popular trend, but it can be technically challenging. Manually skewing and positioning each element to create a cohesive 3D scene is time-consuming and r...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. The core math involves applying a transformation matrix to 2D vector nodes to project them onto an isometric plane. The plugin would offer presets for different projection angles (top, left, right). The complexity comes from building a user-friendly interface and managing an asset library.

### [Brand Pattern Generator](../../design-tools/brand-pattern-generator/)

### [UI Flow AutoMapper](../../design-tools/ui-flow-automapper/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.5/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Creating user flow diagrams can be time-consuming – designers often manually draw flowcharts to show how screens connect (e.g. login -> dashboard -> settings). While Figma has prototyping links, there...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10 – Parsing the graph of screens and connections is straightforward; the challenge is nicely laying it out without overlaps. We might use a basic heuristic (e.g. column by app section). Ensuring it looks clean for very complex flows might be tough, but we can start simple. No server needed; all computation and creation done within Figma environment.

### [Figma2Notion (Design-to-Docs)](../../design-tools/figma2notion-design-to-docs/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.5/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Teams often document their designs in Notion or Confluence – including screenshots of designs with descriptions. Currently, designers manually export images and paste them into docs, then write descri...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10 – Dealing with the Notion API (auth flow and formatting content in their JSON structure) is a bit of work, but the scope is limited: just placing images and text. Possibly have to host images? Notion API might require an image URL; if so, we might have to upload images to a storage (this would break zero-server if we need our own storage). However, we can possibly use Notion’s ability to encode images from URLs: maybe we upload to an anonymous image host (not ideal) or use base64 (if Notion supports). Alternatively, instruct user to copy/paste if needed. If Confluence, their API might allow attachments upload. So complexity revolves around file upload without our server. Perhaps we leverage GitHub Gist or data URI (Notion might not accept data URI for images). This needs careful approach to remain serverless. Maybe we push the burden: e.g. open a browser tab with all images and user saves them to Notion – not elegant. Perhaps limit MVP to generating text content with frame names and a link to Figma prototypes (which can be embedded by link in Notion), if file upload is a problem. In any case, core complexity is medium.

### [MockupMaker (Device Mockup Generator)](../../design-tools/mockupmaker-device-mockup-generator/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.5/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Presenting designs in realistic device frames (like an iPhone mockup, or a browser window around a web design) is a common task for portfolios, client presentations, or marketing assets. Designers cur...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10 – The main challenge is maintaining quality and correct scaling. E.g., an iPhone X screen is a certain pixel size; we need to scale the design into the device overlay correctly. If resolution differences, ensure output isn’t blurry (maybe export at 2x). Figma can handle overlay images well. Possibly minor math to place for angled templates (Angle plugin uses perspective transforms which Figma can’t natively do except via distort which is tricky; maybe we stick to flat front-facing for simplicity, or provide multiple pre-angled images and just place flat design and skew it visually – not perfect without actual transform). Might just avoid heavy 3D transforms, focus on flat and pseudo-3D side-by-side or rotated views.

- **Platforms:** Jasper Canvas
- **Problem:** Startups and small businesses need to send out press releases for launches or funding announcements but often can't afford a PR agency. Writing a professional press release that follows the standard f...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10. This is a well-structured Jasper workflow with a series of prompts for each section of the press release (headline, dateline, introduction, body, boilerplate, contact info).

### [FigTask (Integrated Task Lists)](../../design-tools/figtask-integrated-task-lists/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $800/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Design teams often juggle external project management tools for tracking design to-dos, which means leaving Figma to check tasks or update statuses. Minor tasks (like “fix padding here” or “replace im...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10 – The UI and storage are simple. The main complexity is if we implement external sync (auth flows for APIs like Trello/Jira) – but that can be gated to Pro. A purely internal version is very simple. Ensuring tasks persist and possibly are shareable with team (Figma plugin data is per file and accessible to all editors of that file, so that’s doable). No server needed; integration calls go directly from client to external APIs if used.

### [Unused Asset Finder](../../design-tools/unused-asset-finder/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $600/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Figma files, especially older ones, accumulate unused components, styles, and layers (like hidden or detached elements). This bloat makes files heavier and design systems messy. Designers have no easy...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10 – Listing and matching IDs is straightforward. Removing a style via plugin might not be directly possible (styles may require user action to delete if used; if truly unused, we might simulate deletion by creating an edit). For components, we can flag them for user to manually delete or possibly move them to a “Trash” page. Ensuring accuracy (not flagging something as unused when it is used) is important, but we can double-check references easily.

### [Redline & Spec Exporter](../../design-tools/redline-spec-exporter/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $3,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** The developer handoff process requires designers to manually create "redline" specifications, detailing measurements, colors, fonts, and asset information. While Figma's Dev Mode helps, creating a com...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. This is a complex geometry and data extraction task. The plugin needs to measure distances between elements, read all their properties (fills, strokes, fonts, etc.), identify which assets should be exportable, and then programmatically generate a new, well-organized Figma frame containing all this information.

### [Reading Mode Pro](../../design-tools/reading-mode-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $3,000/month
- **Platforms:** Chrome Extension
- **Problem:** Many websites, especially news sites and blogs, are cluttered with ads, pop-ups, and distracting sidebars, making it difficult to read articles. While some browsers have a built-in reader mode, it's o...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. The core of the extension is a sophisticated algorithm (likely based on a library like Mozilla's ) to reliably extract the main article content from a cluttered HTML page. This is the hardest part. The UI for the reader view itself is straightforward.

### [Better Comments Pro](../../design-tools/better-comments-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,000/month
- **Platforms:** Vscode Extension
- **Problem:** The popular Better Comments extension helps organize comments by color-coding them based on prefixes like *, !, ?, and TODO. However, it lacks features for managing and navigating these annotations....
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10. The color-coding is done with editor decorations. The sidebar panel would be a custom tree view that is populated by scanning the workspace for comments with the special prefixes.

### [Publish to Web Pro](../../design-tools/publish-to-web-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $4,000/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** Obsidian's official Publish service is excellent but can be expensive for users who just want to share a few notes publicly. Other methods require complex setups with Git and static site generators....
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. This requires a serverless backend. The plugin would send the note's content to a serverless function, which then deploys it as a simple static page. The user would need to connect their own Vercel/Netlify account.

### [Vault Visualizer](../../design-tools/vault-visualizer/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.4/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,000/month

- **Problem:** Writing effective copy for a landing page is one of the hardest tasks in marketing. It requires a deep understanding of the target audience and persuasive copywriting skills, which many founders and m...
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10. A multi-step Jasper workflow that generates copy for each section of a landing page sequentially: Headline, Sub-headline, Social Proof, Feature/Benefit blocks, FAQ, and Call-to-Action.

### [StyleDoc Generator](../../design-tools/styledoc-generator/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,200/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** When handing off to developers or documenting a design system, designers spend time creating style guides manually – listing colors, fonts, spacings, etc. It’s repetitive to extract this info from Fig...
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10 – Creating Figma nodes via plugin is straightforward. The complexity is in deciding how to display components (maybe snapshot each component as an icon, which might be tricky without an API to render – but we can instantiate each component master on the doc page as an instance to show it). Also if there are many styles, making it nicely paginated or scrollable is something to design carefully. Still, it’s manageable with static rules (e.g. 4 columns of color swatches, etc.).

### [SpellCheck+ (Content Proofreader)](../../design-tools/spellcheck-content-proofreader/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Figma currently doesn’t have a built-in spell check or grammar check across all text, meaning typos can slip through in designs (embarrassing in client presentations or when copying text to production...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10 – Checking large amounts of text can be slow in JS, but maybe okay unless the file is huge. An external API might be needed for robust suggestions, which raises complexity about network and API costs. Perhaps as MVP just identify likely misspellings (flag words not in dictionary) which covers most use cases. Multi-language detection is another complexity if we support non-English; maybe out of scope for now, or require user to pick language. The actual replacing of text is easy via Figma API. UI to review each issue is moderate complexity (like a little panel “Word X not found, suggestions:... [Replace] [Ignore]”).

### [Localize Preview](../../design-tools/localize-preview/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,200/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Designing with localization in mind is challenging. Text that fits in English might overflow in German or French, and right-to-left languages or different scripts (Chinese, Arabic) can break layouts. ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10 – Replacing text across many nodes with foreign characters could break some text formatting (e.g., if the designer manually bolded part of a string, a naive replace loses that styling). We might ignore those edge cases or replace whole text nodes at once. Also, ensuring we revert back to original easily (we should store original strings to restore). So we need a good undo/restore strategy (maybe one-click restore all text to original, saved in plugin memory or attached data). Using external translation API is straightforward but dealing with API keys or cost is a consideration. Perhaps just use a free tier with limited characters (DeepL or Google have some free limit). If high usage, a cost issue – pass that to user by requiring their key if heavy.

### [TokenExport Pro](../../design-tools/tokenexport-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,000/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Developers need design tokens (colors, fonts, spacings) from Figma, but extracting them manually or via JSON is cumbersome. Inconsistent handoff of these values can lead to mismatches between design a...
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10 – Listing styles and constructing strings for code is straightforward. Slight complexity in formatting (units, naming conventions) and providing UI for user to select output format. No server needed; the plugin can trigger download of files or copy code to clipboard.

### [Design AI Assistant (UXCritique)](../../design-tools/design-ai-assistant-uxcritique/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Designers (especially less experienced ones) may not see certain usability or design issues in their work. Design reviews often depend on expert feedback, which is not always available. Having an “ext...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10 – Summarizing a visual design into text for AI is challenging. We might use Figma node tree: read layer names, types, maybe relative positions (“button below header text”). The AI might need this context to give specific feedback. Ensuring prompts are concise but thorough is an iterative process. Also, cost: each analysis could hit OpenAI API and cost fractions of a cent; must manage usage and not go bankrupt on free users. Possibly require user to input their API key in free version, or limit to small frames. The actual plugin logic is moderate.

### [Print-Ready Export](../../design-tools/print-ready-export/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Figma is primarily a digital design tool, but designers sometimes need to prepare assets for print (e.g., business cards, posters). Figma lacks native tools for print production, such as CMYK color co...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. Color space conversion (RGB to CMYK) is the most complex part and would likely require a robust client-side JavaScript library. Generating the PDF with proper marks and bleed would also require a PDF generation library. The plugin would essentially be a specialized file converter.

### [Book Tracker Pro](../../design-tools/book-tracker-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,800/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** While many users track their reading in Obsidian, creating a rich library with cover images, metadata, and progress tracking requires manual effort or clunky plugins....
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10. Requires integration with the Google Books API. The main work is in building the UI for searching and displaying book information.

### [Dev Handoff Optimizer](../../design-tools/dev-handoff-optimizer/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.2/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $800/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** When handing off designs to developers, a lot of time is spent clarifying measurements, assets, and intended behaviors. Figma provides some info in inspect mode, but designers often still create custo...
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10 – Listing and checking layers is fine. Possibly the trickiest part is if we try to do a zip file of exports – Figma plugin can save files to the user’s computer via the UI (like trigger a download), but bundling might require base64 and link. We might skip automated bundling if too hard and just highlight to user what to export. If we attempt it: export images as bytes, then maybe use a JS zip library in plugin to create a zip blob and offer link to download – might be feasible. That would raise complexity but doable in JS.

### [CopySync (Figma Text Sync)](../../design-tools/copysync-figma-text-sync/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.1/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Keeping design content in sync with copy documents is a pain. Designers often copy-paste updated text from Google Docs or spreadsheets into Figma manually, leading to version mismatches. This is ineff...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10 – Handling external API from within Figma (Google Sheets API or others) and ensuring no server needed (users may have to provide an API key or use public share links). Google’s API usage might need OAuth – which is tricky without a backend, but we can use the simpler approach: require the sheet to be published or use an API key restricted to that sheet. Alternatively, let users upload a CSV. The two-way sync (export text) involves iterating Figma nodes and generating CSV. All doable in plugin environment.

### [A11y Analyzer (Accessibility Assistant)](../../design-tools/a11y-analyzer-accessibility-assistant/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.1/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Beyond color contrast, other accessibility considerations in design (like sufficient tap target sizes, proper heading structures, use of semantic annotations) are often overlooked in the design phase....
- **Technical Complexity:** 7/10 – Some aspects like analyzing touch target sizes means scanning for components that look like buttons (maybe based on layer naming or type) and measuring them – we might need heuristics. Colorblind filter: applying a matrix to colors or exporting image and modifying might be heavy if done in plugin (maybe just approximate by adjusting colors, or request user to visually inspect via filter CSS in plugin UI?). Screen reader sim: would require reading text layers in order – could attempt to output a text outline of the screen by traversing layers (assuming reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom from canvas coordinates or layer order). That’s complex to perfect. Possibly an iterative approach where initial version focuses on easier checks (size, contrast, maybe colorblind filter) and later adds others.

### [Layer Path Copier](../../design-tools/layer-path-copier/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.1/10
- **Revenue Potential:** Not specified
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** When writing documentation or communicating with developers, designers often need to refer to a specific layer within a complex file. Manually typing out the nested path (e.g., Page > Frame > Group > ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 2/10. The logic is very simple. It requires getting the selected node, then traversing up its parent property repeatedly until it reaches the canvas, building the path string along the way.

### [Developer's Toolbox](../../design-tools/developers-toolbox/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.1/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,800/month
- **Platforms:** Chrome Extension
- **Problem:** Web developers frequently need small utility tools like a JSON formatter, a color picker, a ruler for measuring elements, or a placeholder text generator. Using separate extensions for each clutters t...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. This is essentially a collection of smaller tools. Each tool (e.g., color picker, ruler) is its own small project. The complexity comes from integrating them all into a single, polished UI.

### [Crypto Wallet Address Book](../../design-tools/crypto-wallet-address-book/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.1/10
- **Revenue Potential:** Not specified
- **Platforms:** Crypto Browser Tools
- **Problem:** Users frequently send crypto to the same set of addresses (their own exchange deposit address, friends' wallets, etc.). Copying and pasting these long, complex addresses is tedious and carries the ris...
- **Technical Complexity:** 2/10. A very simple extension that stores a list of addresses and labels in the browser's secure local storage.

### [Error Lens Pro](../../design-tools/error-lens-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.0/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $4,000/month
- **Platforms:** Vscode Extension
- **Problem:** The built-in error highlighting in VSCode is good, but it can be subtle. The popular Error Lens extension improves this by showing errors inline, but it could be enhanced with more context and AI-powe...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. The extension would use the VSCode Diagnostics API to get error information from the linter. It would then send the error message and the relevant code snippet to an AI API to get an explanation or a suggested fix.

### [PersonaPalette (AI Image & Icon Finder)](../../design-tools/personapalette-ai-image-icon-finder/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,500/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Designers frequently need to insert placeholder images (like user avatars, product photos) or icons during design. Searching for these assets outside Figma (stock sites or Google) interrupts workflow....
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10 – The search and API calls are fine. The hardest part is dealing with the results display in plugin UI and inserting assets efficiently. Also, handling AI generation: dealing with latency (show a loading indicator while image generates), possibly errors if inappropriate or if it fails. Also ensuring we abide by usage rights – Unsplash is free for commercial, icons depend on source (we’d pick open license libraries). AI images – need to clarify they are AI generated (some policies might require it). So complexity lies partly in UX and partly in ethical considerations.

### [Component Prop Sorter](../../design-tools/component-prop-sorter/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** Not specified
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** As Figma components become more complex with dozens of variants and properties, the property panel can become a disorganized mess. This makes it difficult for designers to quickly find and toggle the ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10. Requires using the Figma API to get the component set definition and its properties, reordering the property array, and then updating the component definition. The main challenge is ensuring the reordering doesn't corrupt the component.

### [SVG Animation Exporter](../../design-tools/svg-animation-exporter/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,800/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Creating simple UI animations (like hover states or loading spinners) and exporting them for web use can be complex. Tools like LottieFiles are powerful but can be overkill for simple animations, and ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. The UI would allow a user to sequence component variants to create an animation timeline. The core technical challenge is building the exporter, which would need to generate the XML code for an animated SVG or use a client-side JavaScript library to compile a GIF.

### [Extension Pack Manager](../../design-tools/extension-pack-manager/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** Not specified
- **Platforms:** Vscode Extension
- **Problem:** Onboarding a new developer to a team often involves a long checklist of "required" VSCode extensions. Ensuring everyone has the same set of tools for a project is a manual process....
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10. The extension would read a custom config file (e.g., .vscode/) from the project root. It would then use the VSCode API to check which extensions are installed and prompt the user to install any that are missing.

### [Prettier Playground](../../design-tools/prettier-playground/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** Not specified
- **Platforms:** Vscode Extension
- **Problem:** Teams using Prettier often debate the optimal configuration settings (printWidth, tabWidth, etc.). Testing out different configurations requires editing the .prettierrc file and re-saving files, which...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10. The extension would use the Prettier JavaScript API in a webview. The UI would consist of controls for the various Prettier options and text areas for the input and output code.

### [Inline To-Do Lists](../../design-tools/inline-to-do-lists/)

### [Gas Fee Watcher](../../design-tools/gas-fee-watcher/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** Not specified
- **Platforms:** Crypto Browser Tools
- **Problem:** High and volatile transaction fees (gas) on networks like Ethereum are a major pain point for users. Timing transactions for when gas is cheap can save significant money, but this requires constantly ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 3/10. The extension periodically calls a public gas price API (e.g., from Etherscan or any node provider) and updates the icon in the browser toolbar. All logic is client-side.

### [Impermanent Loss Calculator](../../design-tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/)

### [Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid)](../../design-tools/design-merge-request-collaboration-aid/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $400/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** When multiple designers collaborate or iterate on the same file, changes can override each other. Figma’s branching feature (for org accounts) addresses this, but many teams on lower plans lack a stru...
- **Technical Complexity:** 7/10 – Implementing a reliable diff for design layers is complex. Visual diff (like snapshot images pixel compare) could be easier but not precise for content changes. A simpler approach: traverse layer tree and find mismatches (text changed, layer moved by x px, color changed) and list them. That’s doable but needs careful recursion and tolerance for minor differences (like if a shadow changed or an auto-layout reflow slightly moved something). We can narrow to changes in properties we care about: position, size, fill, text content. It doesn’t have to catch every nuance (like if two icons swapped positions, though that would appear as two position changes). For merging, actually applying differences programmatically means we’d manipulate the original frame’s layers – possible but risk of messing up if structure diverged. Perhaps leave merge to user using our guidance. Focus on compare and summary.

### [LayerSage (Auto-Organize & Name)](../../design-tools/layersage-auto-organize-name/)
- **Quality Score:** 5.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $800/month
- **Platforms:** Figma Plugin
- **Problem:** Large Figma files often get disorganized – layer names like “Rectangle 123” or random grouping, making it hard to navigate or hand off to others. Cleaning up layers by grouping logically and renaming ...
- **Technical Complexity:** 7/10 – Grouping layers programmatically without messing up constraints or component structures is tricky. We must ensure if we create a group, we don’t disrupt auto-layout or component definitions – maybe limit to frames where grouping won’t break layout. Or only rename and not group if auto-layout present. Renaming is easier (just changing name property). Using AI for icon naming means extracting image data and calling an API like Azure Vision or custom model, possible but adds to cost. We could stick to using existing layer name or library info (if an icon is from a known set, might already have a name). The complexity is mostly in not screwing up the file integrity while improving it.

### [Contrast Guardian](../../design-tools/contrast-guardian/)
