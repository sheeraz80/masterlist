## Projects by Quality Score

### [Team Collaboration Toolkit](../../content-writing/team-collaboration-toolkit/)
- **Quality Score:** 7.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $8,000/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** While Obsidian is primarily a single-user tool, small teams want to use it for collaborative knowledge management. The official Sync service allows for vault sharing, but lacks real-time collaboration...
- **Technical Complexity:** Building a stable, performant, real-time collaboration engine is a massive technical undertaking. Market Risk: Competing with established collaborative tools like Notion or Google Docs is difficult. The target is teams who are deeply committed to Obsidian's local-first, Markdown-based philosophy.

### [Encrypted Notes](../../content-writing/encrypted-notes/)
- **Quality Score:** 7.0/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,500/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** Obsidian's local-first nature is great for privacy, but some users want an extra layer of security to encrypt specific sensitive notes (e.g., journals, financial information, passwords) within their v...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. The plugin would use a standard, well-vetted JavaScript encryption library (like AES from crypto-js). The core logic involves taking the note's content, encrypting it with a user-provided password, and replacing the note's content with the encrypted ciphertext.

### [Customer Review to Testimonial Generator](../../content-writing/customer-review-to-testimonial-generator/)
- **Quality Score:** 7.0/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $2,000/month
- **Platforms:** Jasper Canvas
- **Problem:** Marketing teams know that customer testimonials are powerful social proof, but collecting them and editing them into compelling copy is a manual process. Raw reviews are often too long, poorly written...
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. Requires a serverless function to handle the scraping of review sites. The scraped text is then fed into a Jasper prompt designed to identify the core benefit in the review and rewrite it as a concise, powerful testimonial.

### [Zotero Pro Sync](../../content-writing/zotero-pro-sync/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.9/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $6,000/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** Researchers rely on Zotero for reference management, but the process of getting citation data and annotations into Obsidian can be clunky. Existing plugins offer basic import but lack deep, two-way sy...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. Requires using the Zotero API and potentially a Zotero plugin on the other end to facilitate the two-way sync. The logic for matching and updating annotations without creating duplicates is the main challenge.

### [PDF++ Pro](../../content-writing/pdf-pro/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.8/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $3,200/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** The PDF++ plugin allows for PDF annotation within Obsidian, which is a huge step forward. However, it lacks advanced features like extracting highlighted text into a separate summary note or searching...
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. Requires reading the annotation data created by PDF++ (or building its own annotation layer) and then programmatically creating new notes or building a custom search index for the annotations.

### [Simple Upvote/Like Button Widget](../../content-writing/simple-upvotelike-button-widget/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.7/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,000/month
- **Platforms:** Obsidian Plugin
- **Problem:** Creators who use Notion to publish content (like blog posts or public wikis) have no way to gauge audience engagement. They can't see if readers find a page useful or interesting, as there's no native...
- **Technical Complexity:** 4/10. Requires a simple backend (serverless function + database like Firebase) to store the vote count for each unique page URL. The widget itself is just a simple embeddable button.

### [Web Page Health Checker](../../content-writing/web-page-health-checker/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.6/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $3,000/month
- **Platforms:** Chrome Extension
- **Problem:** Users, especially non-technical ones, have no easy way to check a webpage for common issues like broken links, missing images, or basic SEO problems....
- **Technical Complexity:** 5/10. The extension's content script would parse the DOM of the current page to find all links and images. It then makes fetch requests to check the status of each link and image URL. SEO data is extracted directly from the page's HTML.

### [Book & Reading Tracker](../../content-writing/book-reading-tracker/)
- **Quality Score:** 6.3/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $1,500/month
- **Platforms:** Notion Templates
- **Problem:** Avid readers want to track the books they've read, want to read, and are currently reading. They also want to save notes and favorite quotes. Using separate apps like Goodreads and a notebook is not a...
