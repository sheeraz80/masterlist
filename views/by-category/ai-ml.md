- **Quality Score:** 7.0/10
- **Revenue Potential:** $10,000/month
- **Platforms:** Chrome Extension
- **Problem:** Shoppers on Amazon want to buy items when they are on sale or when a popular, out-of-stock item becomes available again. Constantly checking the product page is impractical....
- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. This requires a backend service that runs 24/7. The extension sends the product URL and alert criteria to the backend. The backend service then periodically scrapes the Amazon product page to check the price and stock status. When an alert condition is met, it sends a browser push notification to the user.

- **Technical Complexity:** 6/10. The extension's content script scans the form fields on a page. It uses an LLM to analyze the labels, placeholders, and surrounding text to understand the semantic meaning of each field (e.g., identifying "Company Name" even if the field id is field_123). It then fills the form from the user's locally stored data.
