# ScholarAI Sidekick

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Researchers, students, and knowledge workers spend an inordinate amount of time sifting through academic papers and articles to find relevant information. The process of summarizing dense text, finding citations, and discovering related work is manual and inefficient, breaking their research flow.

**Solution:** An AI-powered research assistant that activates on any article or PDF, providing one-click summaries, extracting key findings, generating citations in multiple formats, and finding related papers from a massive academic database.

**Target Users:** Academics, graduate students, journalists, and corporate researchers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium with a credit-based system for advanced features.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,200/mo; Realistic: $10,000/mo; Optimistic: $40,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension would use a content script to analyze the page text. This text is sent to a large language model (LLM) API (like GPT-4o or Claude) for summarization and analysis. It would also integrate with a free academic search API like Semantic Scholar to find related papers. All processing is done via API calls, with no server-side data storage.

## Competition Level
High. Tools like Perplexity, Elicit, and SciSpace offer similar functionalities. The unique value proposition is creating a seamless, in-browser "sidekick" that integrates directly into the user's existing reading workflow on any website, rather than requiring them to go to a separate platform.

## Key Features
- Contextual Summarization: Summarize any webpage, article, or online PDF with one click.
- Key Findings Extraction: AI pulls out the main arguments, methodologies, and conclusions from a research paper.
- AI-Powered Literature Review: Based on the current article, the tool suggests a list of prior and subsequent works, creating a "connected papers" graph.
- Citation Generator: Instantly generate citations for the current article in APA, MLA, Chicago, and other formats.
- "Explain Like I'm 5" Mode: Simplifies complex jargon and concepts for easier understanding.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit pack sales, number of active users, and testimonials from researchers about significant time savings.
