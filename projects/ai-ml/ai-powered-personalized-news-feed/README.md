# AI-Powered Personalized News Feed

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users are inundated with information from news sites and blogs. It's hard to keep up with topics they care about without being overwhelmed by clickbait and irrelevant content.

**Solution:** An AI-powered extension that learns a user's interests based on their browsing history (privately, on-device). It then creates a personalized "For You" news feed on the new tab page, summarizing articles from across the web that match their specific interests.

**Target Users:** News junkies, lifelong learners, and anyone who wants a more curated information diet.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
Building a privacy-preserving recommendation engine that runs client-side is very difficult. Filter Bubble Risk: The tool could inadvertently create a strong filter bubble. Giving users control over source diversity is a key mitigation.

## Competition Level
High. Many apps and services aim to provide personalized news (e.g., Google News, Apple News). The niche here is a browser-native, privacy-first approach that is based on the user's actual browsing, not just declared interests.

## Key Features
- Automatic Interest Profiling: AI learns what you're interested in based on the articles you read.
- Personalized New Tab Page: Your new tab shows a feed of summarized articles tailored to you.
- Source Diversity Controls: Users can adjust sliders to get more or less content from certain types of sources (e.g., mainstream news, independent blogs, academic journals).
- "Less Like This" Button: A simple feedback mechanism to fine-tune the recommendations.
- Completely Private: The user's interest profile never leaves their device.

## Success Indicators
Daily active users, Pro subscriber count, and user satisfaction with the relevance of the recommended content.
