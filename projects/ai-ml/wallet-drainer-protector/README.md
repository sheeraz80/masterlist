# Wallet Drainer Protector

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** A sophisticated scam involves tricking users into signing a transaction that drains all of their assets. These "wallet drainer" scripts are a major threat, and standard wallets don't always protect against them.

**Solution:** A security extension that specifically focuses on detecting and blocking wallet drainer scripts. It monitors the JavaScript on a page and looks for patterns and functions commonly used by drainers, blocking them before they can even prompt the user's wallet.

**Target Users:** All crypto users, especially those active in NFTs and new DeFi protocols.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Jasper Canvas](./platforms/jasper-canvas/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $8,000/mo; Optimistic: $25,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is a complex security tool. It requires maintaining a library of known malicious code signatures and using heuristic analysis to detect new, unknown drainer scripts by analyzing their behavior.

## Competition Level
Medium. This is a feature of some anti-virus software and other security extensions, but a dedicated, crypto-specific tool could be more effective.

## Key Features
- Malicious Script Detection: Actively scans web pages for code patterns associated with wallet drainers.
- Real-Time Blocking: Blocks malicious scripts from executing and warns the user.
- Community Reporting: A simple way for users to report new suspicious sites to help improve the detection database.
- Lightweight & Performant: Designed to run in the background without slowing down the browser.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and a strong reputation for successfully protecting users.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
