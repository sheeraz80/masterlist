# FAQ Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating a comprehensive FAQ page for a new product or service is a challenge because it's hard to anticipate all the questions potential customers might have.

**Solution:** An AI tool that scans a product's landing page URL or a provided product description. It then uses Jasper to generate a list of likely frequently asked questions and provides draft answers for each.

**Target Users:** Startup founders, product managers, and customer support teams.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. Requires a serverless function to scrape the URL content. This content is then fed to an LLM with a prompt like, "Based on this product description, generate a list of 15 frequently asked questions a potential customer might have. Then, provide a draft answer for each question based on the available information."
