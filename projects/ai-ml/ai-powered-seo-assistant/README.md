# AI-Powered SEO Assistant

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Content creators and SEO specialists need to optimize their content for search engines, which involves checking for keyword density, readability, heading structure, and other on-page factors. This is typically done with multiple separate tools.

**Solution:** An all-in-one AI SEO assistant that lives in a browser sidebar. When viewing a webpage (e.g., a blog post in a CMS editor), it provides a real-time SEO score and actionable recommendations for improvement based on a target keyword.

**Target Users:** SEO professionals, content marketers, and bloggers.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension analyzes the DOM of the current page. It uses an LLM API to perform tasks like readability analysis and to generate suggestions. It would also need to integrate with a keyword data API to pull in search volume and related keywords.

## Competition Level
High. Tools like Surfer SEO and Clearscope are market leaders. The niche for a browser extension is to provide a more affordable, lightweight, and integrated experience for users who don't need the full power (or price tag) of those platforms.

## Key Features
