# AI-Powered PDF Chat - Ai Browser Tools Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. The extension would need to extract the text content from the PDF. For local PDFs, this can be done with a JavaScript library. This text is then chunked and sent to an LLM API along with the user's question, using a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure the answers are based only on the document's content.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
