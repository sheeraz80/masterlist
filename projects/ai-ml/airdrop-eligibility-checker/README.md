# Airdrop Eligibility Checker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Airdrops are a key way for crypto users to earn tokens, but tracking eligibility across hundreds of protocols and chains is nearly impossible. Users often miss out on free money because they don't know they qualify.

**Solution:** A simple extension that scans a user's connected wallet addresses against a curated database of known and rumored airdrops, providing a simple dashboard of potential claims.

**Target Users:** Active DeFi users, NFT traders, and "airdrop farmers."

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium (with affiliate/referral links).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The core of the product is the curated database of airdrop criteria. The extension itself is simple: it takes the user's public address and checks their on-chain activity (e.g., "has used Uniswap," "has bridged to zkSync") against the criteria in the database.

## Competition Level
Medium. Several websites and Twitter accounts provide this information, but an automated checker that integrates with a user's wallet is a more efficient solution.

## Key Features
- Eligibility Dashboard: A clean UI showing a list of airdrops the user is potentially eligible for.
- Actionable Steps: For upcoming airdrops, it provides a simple checklist of actions the user can take to qualify.
- Claim Links: Provides direct, verified links to the official claim pages for live airdrops.
- New Airdrop Notifications (Pro): A premium feature that sends a browser notification when a new potential airdrop is added that the user qualifies for.
- Referral Links: Links to protocols or bridges needed to qualify for an airdrop can be tagged with the developer's referral code.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user reports of successful claims found via the tool.
