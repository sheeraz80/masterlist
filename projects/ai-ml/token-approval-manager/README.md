# Token Approval Manager

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Over time, users grant token approvals to dozens of dApps. A vulnerability in any one of these dApps could allow an attacker to drain all approved tokens from the user's wallet. Most users have no easy way to see or revoke these risky approvals.

**Solution:** A simple, security-focused extension that scans a user's wallet address, displays a list of all active token approvals, and allows the user to revoke them with a single click.

**Target Users:** All DeFi and NFT users.
