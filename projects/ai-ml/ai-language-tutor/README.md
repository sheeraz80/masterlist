# AI Language Tutor

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Language learners need constant practice and correction. When browsing foreign language websites, they often encounter words and grammatical structures they don't understand, but there's no easy way to get instant, contextual feedback.

**Solution:** An AI-powered language tutor that analyzes any selected text on a webpage. It not only translates the text but also breaks down the grammar, explains idioms, and offers alternative phrasings to help the user learn.

**Target Users:** Language learners, expatriates, and students.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension sends the selected text and the surrounding context to an LLM API with a prompt like, "Translate this French text, explain the use of the subjunctive mood in this sentence, and provide two alternative ways to phrase it."

## Competition Level
Medium. Translation extensions are common, but a tool focused on tutoring and explanation is a more specific niche. Tools like Toucan are similar but focus on passive immersion.
