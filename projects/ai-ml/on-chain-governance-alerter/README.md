# On-Chain Governance Alerter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Token holders in DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have the right to vote on governance proposals, but it's difficult to keep track of new proposals and voting deadlines across multiple projects.

**Solution:** An extension that monitors governance forums and on-chain proposals for the DAOs a user is interested in. It provides browser notifications when a new proposal is created or when a voting period is about to end.

**Target Users:** Active DAO members, token holders, and governance researchers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.0/10

### Score Breakdown

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $7,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension would need to scrape or use APIs from governance platforms like Snapshot, Tally, and various DAO forums. It would store the user's followed DAOs and send notifications based on new activity.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a niche tool that solves a real problem for a highly engaged and often wealthy user base.

## Key Features
- DAO Watchlist: Users can create a list of DAOs they want to track.

- Voting Reminders: Get a reminder 24 hours before a voting period ends.
- Governance Dashboard: A single page showing all active proposals for your watched DAOs.
- Delegate Alerts (Pro): A premium feature to track the voting activity of specific delegates you follow.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and becoming an essential tool for active DAO participants.
