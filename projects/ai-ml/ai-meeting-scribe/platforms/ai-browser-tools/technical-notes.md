# AI Meeting Scribe - Ai Browser Tools Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10. This is complex. It requires using browser APIs to capture audio from the meeting tab. This audio stream is then sent to a real-time speech-to-text API. The resulting transcript is then processed by an LLM to generate the summary and action items. This requires a robust, low-latency architecture.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A browser extension that joins your Google Meet or Zoom calls, provides real-time transcription, and automatically generates a concise summary, a list of action items, and key decisions after the meeting ends.
