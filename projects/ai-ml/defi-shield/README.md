# DeFi Shield

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The biggest barrier to entry for new DeFi users is the risk of scams and interacting with malicious smart contracts. One wrong signature can drain an entire wallet, and it's often impossible to tell if a transaction is safe just by looking at the wallet's confirmation prompt.

**Solution:** A security-focused extension that simulates transactions before they are signed, warning users about potential risks like giving away unlimited token approvals or interacting with known scam addresses.

**Target Users:** New and intermediate DeFi users, NFT traders, and anyone interacting with dApps.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.4/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,500/mo; Realistic: $12,000/mo; Optimistic: $40,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires using a transaction simulation API (like those from Tenderly or Blocknative) or forking a mainnet locally. The core challenge is interpreting the simulation results and presenting them to the user in a simple, non-technical way.

## Competition Level
Medium. Wallets like Rabby and extensions like Kerberus offer transaction simulation. The opportunity is to create a more user-friendly tool with clearer explanations and broader dApp compatibility, acting as a universal "seatbelt" for any wallet.

## Key Features
- Transaction Simulation: Before a wallet signature prompt appears, the extension shows a plain-English summary of what the transaction will do (e.g., "You are giving Uniswap permission to spend all of your USDC").
- Scam Address Database: Cross-references the contract address with a community-maintained list of known phishing and scam addresses.
- Token Approval Management: Provides a dashboard to view and revoke active token approvals that could pose a risk.
- Phishing Site Warning: Blocks navigation to known crypto scam websites, similar to DeFiLlama's extension.
- Security Score: Provides a simple "safety score" for any dApp the user visits based on its age, audit history, and community trust signals.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user testimonials about scams that were successfully prevented.

## Additional Information
