# DeFi Shield - Crypto Browser Tools Features

## Core Features
- Transaction Simulation: Before a wallet signature prompt appears, the extension shows a plain-English summary of what the transaction will do (e.g., "You are giving Uniswap permission to spend all of your USDC").
- Scam Address Database: Cross-references the contract address with a community-maintained list of known phishing and scam addresses.
- Token Approval Management: Provides a dashboard to view and revoke active token approvals that could pose a risk.
