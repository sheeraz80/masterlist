# DeFi Shield - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
The biggest barrier to entry for new DeFi users is the risk of scams and interacting with malicious smart contracts. One wrong signature can drain an entire wallet, and it's often impossible to tell if a transaction is safe just by looking at the wallet's confirmation prompt.

### Target Market
New and intermediate DeFi users, NFT traders, and anyone interacting with dApps.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Wallets like Rabby and extensions like Kerberus offer transaction simulation. The opportunity is to create a more user-friendly tool with clearer explanations and broader dApp compatibility, acting as a universal "seatbelt" for any wallet.
