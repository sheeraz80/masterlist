# AI Knowledge Weaver - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
As an Obsidian vault grows, discovering non-obvious connections between notes becomes increasingly difficult. The graph view shows explicit links, but conceptual or thematic relationships remain hidden, limiting the potential for serendipitous discovery and creative insight.

### Target Market
Long-term Obsidian users, researchers, writers, and Zettelkasten enthusiasts.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Plugins like Smart Connections and Copilot offer AI chat and linking features. The unique value here is a passive, always-on "serendipity panel" that requires no active querying, and a focus on local-first processing where possible.

- **Conservative:** 800/mo
- **Realistic:** 7,000/mo
- **Optimistic:** 25,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A freemium subscription model. The core functionality with a local model is free, while the more powerful cloud-based AI and advanced visualizations are paid. Tiers: Free: Local AI model, related notes panel for up to 3 suggestions. Pro ($5/month): Use of external, high-quality AI models (via user's API key), up to 10 suggestions, and graph view integration. Acquisition: Market in the Obsidian community forums and Discord. Create compelling visuals showing the "hidden connections" it uncovers in a demo vault.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Performance Risk: Generating embeddings for a very large vault (10,000+ notes) could be resource-intensive. The scanning process needs to be efficient and run in the background without impacting editor performance. AI Quality Risk: The relevance of the suggestions is paramount. Poor suggestions will make the tool useless.
