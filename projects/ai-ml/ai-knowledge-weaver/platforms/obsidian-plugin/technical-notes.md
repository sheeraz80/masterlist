# AI Knowledge Weaver - Obsidian Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. The core logic involves using a JavaScript library to generate text embeddings. For the free tier, this could use a small, local model. For the pro tier, it would call an external API like OpenAI or Cohere (with the user's own API key) for higher-quality embeddings. The results are stored locally.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An AI-powered plugin that periodically scans the vault, creating vector embeddings for each note and identifying the top 5 "unlinked but related" notes in the sidebar for any active note, sparking new connections.
