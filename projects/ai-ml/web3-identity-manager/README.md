# Web3 Identity Manager

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** In Web3, a user's identity is fragmented across multiple wallet addresses. There is no easy way to manage a public-facing profile that links all of your on-chain activity and social accounts in a privacy-preserving way.

**Solution:** A browser extension that acts as a Web3 identity manager. It allows users to create a public profile linked to their primary ENS/Solana name, and selectively prove ownership of other addresses or social accounts without doxxing them.

**Target Users:** Crypto power users, developers, and creators building an on-chain reputation.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.4/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $3,500/mo; Optimistic: $10,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension would interact with the user's wallet to sign messages, which proves ownership of an address. It could use decentralized identity standards to create verifiable credentials that can be shared with dApps.

## Competition Level
Medium. Services like DeBank offer social profiles. The niche is a more user-controlled, privacy-preserving tool that focuses on verifiable credentials.

## Key Features
- Unified Profile: Create a public profile that aggregates on-chain stats (e.g., "DeFi user since 2020," "Top 1% NFT trader") without revealing specific wallet addresses.
- Verifiable Credentials: Generate credentials (e.g., "Proof of Humanity," "Proof of Gitcoin Donation") that can be presented to dApps to unlock special access.
- Social Account Linking: Securely link Twitter, GitHub, and other social accounts to your Web3 identity.
- Privacy Controls: Granular control over what information is public and what is private.
- dApp Integration (Pro): A premium feature for dApps to easily integrate and request credentials from users of the extension.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active users, and integrations with dApps.
