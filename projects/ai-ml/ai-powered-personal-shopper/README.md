# AI-Powered Personal Shopper

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Online shoppers are often overwhelmed by choice and unsure if a product is right for them. Reading through hundreds of reviews to find relevant information is a major pain point.

**Solution:** An AI-powered shopping assistant that activates on product pages (e.g., Amazon). It reads all the user reviews and provides a concise summary, highlighting the most common pros and cons, and answers specific questions the user has about the product.

**Target Users:** Online shoppers, especially for electronics, appliances, and other high-consideration purchases.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension needs to scrape all the review text from a product page. This text is then sent to an LLM API with a prompt like, "Summarize these product reviews. Identify the top 3 pros and top 3 cons mentioned most frequently."

## Competition Level
Low. While price trackers like The Camelizer are common, an AI review summarizer is a newer, high-value concept.
