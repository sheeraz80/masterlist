# AI-Powered Form Filler

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users frequently fill out the same information on different web forms (contact forms, sign-up forms, checkout pages). While browsers have some autofill capabilities, they are often limited and don't handle complex or custom fields well.

**Solution:** An AI-powered form filler that intelligently analyzes any web form, identifies the fields (even non-standard ones), and fills them out with one click using the user's securely stored personal or business profiles.

**Target Users:** All internet users, especially power users, online shoppers, and small business owners.

## Quality Score

- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $8,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension's content script scans the form fields on a page. It uses an LLM to analyze the labels, placeholders, and surrounding text to understand the semantic meaning of each field (e.g., identifying "Company Name" even if the field id is field_123). It then fills the form from the user's locally stored data.

## Competition Level
Medium. Browser-native autofill and password managers like LastPass offer some of this functionality. The niche is the AI-powered ability to understand and fill any form, not just those with standard name and address fields.

## Key Features
- Intelligent Field Recognition: AI understands non-standard form fields like "What is your primary business goal?" or "How did you hear about us?".
- Multiple Profiles: Create and save different profiles (e.g., "Personal," "Work," "Test User") with different sets of information.
- Secure Local Storage: All user data is stored encrypted on the user's local machine, never on a server.
- One-Click Fill: A single button to fill out an entire form.
- Custom Field Mapping (Pro): A premium feature to manually train the AI on how to fill out specific, complex forms that you use frequently.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and user reviews praising its accuracy and time-saving capabilities.
