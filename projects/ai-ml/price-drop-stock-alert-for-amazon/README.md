# Price Drop & Stock Alert for Amazon

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Shoppers on Amazon want to buy items when they are on sale or when a popular, out-of-stock item becomes available again. Constantly checking the product page is impractical.

**Solution:** A simple extension that adds an "Alert Me" button to Amazon product pages. Users can set a target price or request a notification when an item comes back in stock.

**Target Users:** Amazon shoppers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.0/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 4/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Affiliate Commissions.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $10,000/mo; Optimistic: $40,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This requires a backend service that runs 24/7. The extension sends the product URL and alert criteria to the backend. The backend service then periodically scrapes the Amazon product page to check the price and stock status. When an alert condition is met, it sends a browser push notification to the user.

## Competition Level
High. Tools like The Camelizer (from CamelCamelCamel) are very well-known and offer this functionality. The opportunity is to create a tool with a better UI, more reliable notifications, and perhaps integration with other retailers.

## Key Features
- Price Drop Alerts: Get a notification when a product's price falls below your desired threshold.
- In-Stock Alerts: Get a notification when a currently unavailable item comes back in stock.
- Simple Interface: A clean "Alert Me" button and management dashboard integrated into the Amazon UI.
- Historical Price Chart: Displays a simple price history chart on the product page.
- Affiliate Integration: All links back to the product are tagged with the developer's Amazon Associates ID.

## Success Indicators
Affiliate revenue generated, number of active alerts, and user conversion rate from notification to purchase.
