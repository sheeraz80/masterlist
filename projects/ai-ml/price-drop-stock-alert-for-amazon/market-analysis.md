### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: Purely affiliate-based. The service is free to the user, and revenue is earned from commissions on purchases made through the alert notifications.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Backend Cost & Complexity: This is not a zero-server project. It requires a backend to run the scrapers and send notifications. This adds complexity and cost, though it can be minimized with serverless architecture. Platform Risk: Amazon actively tries to block scrapers. The scraping logic must be robust and may require using proxy services to avoid being blocked, which adds cost.
