# Cross-Device Tab Sender

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users often find an article or link on their desktop that they want to read later on their phone, or vice-versa. Emailing links to oneself is a common but clunky workaround. Chrome's native "Send to Your Devices" feature can be unreliable and slow.

**Solution:** A simple, fast, and reliable extension to instantly send the current tab to any other device where the user is logged in.

**Target Users:** Anyone who uses Chrome on multiple devices (desktop, laptop, phone).

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.5/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Free.

## Revenue Potential
N/A.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. This requires a minimal serverless backend (e.g., using Firebase/Supabase) to handle real-time messaging. The user authenticates with their Google account. The extension sends the URL to the backend, which then pushes it via a WebSocket or push notification to the user's other logged-in devices.

## Competition Level
Low. While Chrome has a native feature, its unreliability is a common complaint. A third-party tool that is faster and more reliable could gain traction. Opera's "Flow" is a good model.

## Key Features
- Instant Push: Send a tab to another device with a single click.
- Reliable Delivery: Uses a dedicated backend to ensure the link is delivered instantly.
- Cross-Platform: Works between desktop (Chrome, Edge) and mobile (via a simple companion PWA or app).
- Send Text Snippets: In addition to links, allow sending selected text.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users and total links sent.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
