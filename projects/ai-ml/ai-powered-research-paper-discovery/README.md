# AI-Powered Research Paper Discovery

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Researchers often struggle to stay on top of the latest papers in their field. Keyword-based search on platforms like Google Scholar can be noisy and miss relevant papers that use different terminology.

**Solution:** An AI-powered extension that allows a researcher to paste in an abstract or a paragraph describing their research interest. The AI then performs a semantic search across a vast database of academic papers to find the most conceptually similar and relevant articles.

**Target Users:** Academics, PhD students, and R&D professionals.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.7/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 4/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $900/mo; Realistic: $8,000/mo; Optimistic: $30,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
7/10. This requires access to a large corpus of academic papers and the ability to perform vector/semantic search on it. This would likely involve using a specialized API from a provider like Pinecone or a research-focused AI platform, which could be expensive.

## Competition Level
Medium. Tools like Elicit, ResearchRabbit, and Consensus are building platforms around this concept. The niche for an extension is to provide this powerful search capability as a quick, lightweight tool without requiring users to commit to a full platform.

## Key Features
- Semantic Search: Find papers based on the meaning of your research query, not just keywords.
- Abstract-Based Search: Paste in an abstract to find highly similar papers.
- Personalized Feed (Pro): A premium feature that learns from your searches and saved papers to create a personalized feed of new, relevant research.
- Author & Citation Network Visualization: See how the found papers and authors are connected.
- Integration with Zotero/Mendeley: Directly export found papers to your reference manager.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and adoption by research institutions.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
