# AI-Powered Content Calendar

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Content marketers often struggle with the "blank page" problem when planning their content calendar. Coming up with a month's worth of fresh, relevant ideas is a constant challenge.

**Solution:** An AI tool where the user inputs a core topic or theme. The tool then uses Jasper to brainstorm and populate a one-month content calendar on a Jasper Canvas, complete with blog post titles, social media hooks, and newsletter subject lines.

**Target Users:** Content marketers, social media managers, and bloggers.
