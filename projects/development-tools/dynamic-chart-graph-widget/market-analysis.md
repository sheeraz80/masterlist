# Dynamic Chart & Graph Widget - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

Notion's native database features are powerful, but they lack robust data visualization tools. Users who want to create dynamic charts or graphs from their Notion data have to manually export data to Google Sheets or other tools, which is inefficient and doesn't provide a live view.

### Target Market
Business teams, project managers, and data-driven individuals who use Notion for tracking metrics.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low to Medium. A few services like NotionCharts exist, but the market is not saturated. There is room for a competitor with a better UI, more chart types, and a more generous free tier.
