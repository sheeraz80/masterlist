# Dynamic Chart & Graph Widget

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Notion's native database features are powerful, but they lack robust data visualization tools. Users who want to create dynamic charts or graphs from their Notion data have to manually export data to Google Sheets or other tools, which is inefficient and doesn't provide a live view.

**Solution:** An embeddable widget that connects to a Notion database via the official API and renders the data as a beautiful, interactive, and live-updating chart (bar, line, pie, etc.) directly within a Notion page.

**Target Users:** Business teams, project managers, and data-driven individuals who use Notion for tracking metrics.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.3/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Notion Templates](./platforms/notion-templates/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $18,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This requires a web application that uses the Notion API for authentication and data fetching. The front end would use a charting library (like or ) to render the visualization. The app would be hosted on a serverless platform like Vercel.

## Competition Level
Low to Medium. A few services like NotionCharts exist, but the market is not saturated. There is room for a competitor with a better UI, more chart types, and a more generous free tier.

## Key Features
- Notion API Integration: Securely connect to a user's Notion account and select a database.
- Multiple Chart Types: Support for bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.
- Live Data Sync: Charts automatically update when the data in the Notion database changes.
- Customizable Appearance: Users can customize colors, labels, and titles to match their Notion page's aesthetic.
- Embeddable Widget: Generates a simple URL that can be embedded directly into a Notion page.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and the number of active charts being displayed.
