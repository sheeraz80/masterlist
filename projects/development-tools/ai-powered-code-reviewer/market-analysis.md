# AI-Powered Code Reviewer - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Developers spend a lot of time performing and responding to code reviews on platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Many common issues (style violations, potential bugs, lack of documentation) could be caught automatically.

### Target Market
Software development teams, open-source maintainers, and individual developers.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Tools like GitHub Copilot are moving into this space, and dedicated code analysis platforms exist. The niche is a lightweight, in-browser tool that assists the human reviewer rather than replacing them.
