# AI-Assisted Naming Tool

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Coming up with a great name for a new company, product, or feature is one of the hardest creative challenges. Brainstorming sessions can be unproductive, and domain name availability is a major constraint.

**Solution:** A Jasper-powered brainstorming tool. The user inputs a description of their business and some keywords, and the tool generates hundreds of potential names categorized by style (e.g., "Modern/Abstract," "Descriptive," "Playful"). It can also check for domain name availability via an API.

**Target Users:** Entrepreneurs, startup founders, and product managers.
