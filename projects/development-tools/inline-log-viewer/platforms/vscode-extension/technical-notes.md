# Inline Log Viewer - Vscode Extension Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. This is technically complex. It requires intercepting the logging output from the running application (e.g., by wrapping or connecting to a debugger) and then mapping that output back to the specific line in the source code to display it as an inline decoration.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 5-6 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An extension that displays (or other logging) output directly in the editor, right next to the line of code that generated it.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use VS Code Extension API
- Node.js runtime environment
- Limited UI customization options
- Extension host process limitations

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
