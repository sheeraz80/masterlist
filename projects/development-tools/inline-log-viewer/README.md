# Inline Log Viewer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** When debugging, developers often add statements and then have to switch to the browser's developer tools or a terminal to see the output. This context switch breaks the flow of debugging.

**Solution:** An extension that displays (or other logging) output directly in the editor, right next to the line of code that generated it.

**Target Users:** All developers, especially front-end and developers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.4/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is technically complex. It requires intercepting the logging output from the running application (e.g., by wrapping or connecting to a debugger) and then mapping that output back to the specific line in the source code to display it as an inline decoration.

## Competition Level
Medium. The Console Ninja extension is a popular tool in this space. The opportunity is to create a tool that is simpler, supports more languages/log types, or has a better UI.

## Key Features
- Inline Log Display: Shows log output as a subtle annotation next to the corresponding line.
- Real-Time Updates: Logs appear instantly as the code executes.
- Support for Multiple Log Types: Works for , , , etc.
- Click to Expand: Click on a log annotation to see the full object or data structure that was logged.
- Language Support (Pro): A premium version could add support for logging in other languages like Python or Ruby.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and reviews from developers praising its impact on their debugging speed.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
