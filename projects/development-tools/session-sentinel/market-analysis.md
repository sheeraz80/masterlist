# Session Sentinel - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Power users, researchers, and developers often work with dozens of tabs across multiple windows for different projects. An accidental browser crash or restart can wipe out this entire context, leading to lost work and significant time spent trying to restore the session.

### Target Market
Knowledge workers, researchers, developers, and students.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Extensions like Session Buddy are popular and well-established. The opportunity lies in offering a more modern UI, cloud sync capabilities (using user's own Google Drive for zero-server cost), and AI-powered session naming/organization.
