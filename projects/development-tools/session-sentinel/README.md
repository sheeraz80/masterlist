# Session Sentinel

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Power users, researchers, and developers often work with dozens of tabs across multiple windows for different projects. An accidental browser crash or restart can wipe out this entire context, leading to lost work and significant time spent trying to restore the session.

**Solution:** A one-click session manager that saves the current state of all open tabs and windows, allowing for instant restoration or the ability to save named sessions for different projects.

**Target Users:** Knowledge workers, researchers, developers, and students.
