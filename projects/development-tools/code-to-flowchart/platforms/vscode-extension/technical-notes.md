# Code-to-Flowchart - Vscode Extension Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** Parsing code and accurately representing all its control flow paths is very difficult. This is the main risk. Starting with a limited subset of a language's features would be a good MVP strategy. Market Risk: May be seen as a "nice-to-have" by some, but for visual learners or those working on complex algorithms, it could be indispensable.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A visualization tool that automatically generates a simple flowchart diagram from a selected block of code, helping developers understand the control flow at a glance.

## Technical Requirements
