# Code-to-Flowchart

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Understanding complex code logic, especially in an unfamiliar codebase, can be challenging. Reading through nested loops, conditionals, and function calls takes significant mental effort.

**Solution:** A visualization tool that automatically generates a simple flowchart diagram from a selected block of code, helping developers understand the control flow at a glance.

**Target Users:** Developers, students, and technical leads doing code reviews.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $6,500/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
Parsing code and accurately representing all its control flow paths is very difficult. This is the main risk. Starting with a limited subset of a language's features would be a good MVP strategy. Market Risk: May be seen as a "nice-to-have" by some, but for visual learners or those working on complex algorithms, it could be indispensable.

## Competition Level
Low. While some standalone applications do this, an integrated VSCode extension that can generate a flowchart on the fly is a novel and powerful concept for day-to-day development.

## Key Features
- One-Click Generation: Select a function or block of code and generate a flowchart.
- Interactive Diagram: The generated flowchart is interactive; clicking a node in the chart highlights the corresponding line of code.
- Language Support: Starts with support for a single popular language like JavaScript or Python, with others added over time.
- Export to SVG/PNG: Export the generated flowchart for use in documentation or presentations.
- Custom Styling (Pro): Allow users to customize the colors and shapes used in the flowchart.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user testimonials about improved code comprehension.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
