## Revenue Model
Affiliate Commissions.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,500/mo; Realistic: $15,000/mo; Optimistic: $50,000+/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. The coupon-finding feature requires scraping coupon sites or using an API. The price tracking feature requires scraping product pages on major retail sites at regular intervals to build a historical database. This part is challenging to do client-side and may require a minimal serverless function to manage the data scraping and storage.

## Competition Level
High. Extensions like Honey and Rakuten are massive and well-known. The niche to enter is by focusing on a specific vertical (e.g., electronics, fashion, travel) or by offering a better, cleaner user experience with more reliable price tracking data.

## Key Features
- Automatic Coupon Finder: At checkout, the extension automatically tests and applies the best available coupon code.
- Price History Charts: On product pages (e.g., Amazon, Walmart), it overlays a chart showing the product's price history.
- Price Drop Alerts: Users can set a target price for a product and receive a browser notification if the price drops to that level.
- Affiliate Link Integration: Automatically applies the developer's affiliate code to purchases, generating commission.

## Success Indicators
Affiliate revenue, number of active users, and total user savings tracked.
