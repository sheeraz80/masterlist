# Markdown Presentation Studio

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers often need to create simple presentations for technical talks, team meetings, or documentation. Using tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides feels heavy and disconnected from their code-centric workflow.

**Solution:** An extension that allows developers to write slides in a single Markdown file and present them directly from within VSCode, with a clean, code-friendly theme.

**Target Users:** Developers, developer advocates, and technical writers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $1,800/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The core logic involves using a JavaScript library (like or Marpit) to parse the Markdown and render it as an HTML slideshow in a webview panel.

## Competition Level
Medium. Tools like Marp for VS Code exist and are popular. The opportunity is to offer a better user experience, more built-in themes, and advanced features like a presenter view.

## Key Features
- Markdown-Based Slides: Write slides using simple Markdown syntax (e.g., --- to separate slides).
- Live Preview: A side-by-side preview that updates as you type.
- Presenter Mode (Pro): A separate window with speaker notes, a timer, and a preview of the next slide.
- Code Syntax Highlighting: Beautiful, themeable syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- Export to PDF/HTML: Export the final presentation to share with others.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and usage by speakers at tech events.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
