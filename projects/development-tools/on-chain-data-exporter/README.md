# On-Chain Data Exporter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Crypto researchers, analysts, and tax professionals often need to export on-chain data (e.g., all transactions for a specific wallet, all holders of an NFT collection) to a CSV or spreadsheet for further analysis. Doing this manually from a block explorer is impossible for large datasets.

**Solution:** A simple utility that allows users to export on-chain data to a CSV file. The user provides a wallet address, contract address, or transaction hash, and the tool uses a block explorer API to fetch the relevant data and format it for export.

**Target Users:** Crypto data analysts, tax professionals, and researchers.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension would be a UI frontend for a public blockchain data API like Etherscan, Covalent, or NOWNodes. The user would provide their own free-tier API key for the service. The main logic involves handling API pagination and formatting the JSON response into a CSV.

## Competition Level
Low. While some data platforms offer this as part of an expensive subscription, a simple, affordable, client-side tool for this specific task is a clear gap.

## Key Features
- Wallet Transaction Export: Export all transactions for a given wallet address.
- Token Holder Export: Export a list of all holders for a given ERC-20 or ERC-721 token.
- Custom Date Ranges: Filter exports by a specific date range.
- Simple CSV Output: Generates a clean, easy-to-use CSV file.
- Multi-Chain Support (Pro): A premium version that supports exporting data from multiple blockchains.

## Success Indicators
Number of Pro purchases and adoption by professionals for data analysis tasks.
