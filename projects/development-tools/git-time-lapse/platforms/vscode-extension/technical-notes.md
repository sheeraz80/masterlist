# Git Time-Lapse - Vscode Extension Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10. The core logic involves using Git commands (git log, git show) to get the content of the file at each historical commit. The extension would then need to use a client-side library to stitch these snapshots together into a GIF or video format.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 5-6 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A simple extension that generates a "time-lapse" video or GIF of a selected file's Git history, showing the changes from each commit being applied sequentially.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use VS Code Extension API
- Node.js runtime environment
- Limited UI customization options
- Extension host process limitations

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
