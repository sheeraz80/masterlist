# AI-Powered Audio Transcription

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users who record voice memos, interviews, or meeting audio want to work with that content in Obsidian. Manually transcribing audio is incredibly time-consuming and prevents them from easily searching or linking to the content.

**Solution:** A plugin that allows users to embed an audio file in a note and, with one click, sends it to an AI speech-to-text API to generate a full, timestamped transcript directly below the audio player.

**Target Users:** Journalists, students who record lectures, researchers conducting interviews, and anyone who uses voice notes.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The plugin would need to integrate with a third-party transcription API (like OpenAI's Whisper or Deepgram). The user would provide their own API key. The main challenge is handling audio file uploads and displaying the interactive transcript.

## Competition Level
Low. While some users have complex workflows involving external transcription services, a seamlessly integrated, one-click solution within Obsidian is a clear gap.

## Key Features
- One-Click Transcription: Click a button on any embedded audio file to generate a transcript.
- Timestamped Transcript: The generated transcript has timestamps that are clickable, jumping the audio player to that point in the recording.
- Speaker Identification: The AI attempts to identify and label different speakers in the conversation.
- AI Summary: An option to also generate a concise summary of the transcript.
- Local File Support: Works with audio files stored directly in the Obsidian vault.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit pack sales and adoption by users in research and media.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
