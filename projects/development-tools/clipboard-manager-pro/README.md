# Clipboard Manager Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The system clipboard only holds one item at a time. Users who frequently copy and paste multiple pieces of text, code snippets, or images lose time and context by having to constantly switch back and forth between sources.

**Solution:** A powerful clipboard manager that lives in the browser, storing a history of copied items, making them searchable, and allowing for organization into collections.

**Target Users:** Writers, developers, customer support agents, and anyone who does a lot of copy-pasting.
