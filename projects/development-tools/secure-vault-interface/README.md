# Secure Vault Interface

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers need to access secrets (API keys, database passwords) from services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for local development. They often resort to copying and pasting these secrets into .env files, which is insecure.

**Solution:** An extension that provides a direct, read-only interface to a configured secrets manager. It allows developers to securely inject secrets into their local environment for a development session without ever writing them to disk.

**Target Users:** DevOps engineers, backend developers, and security-conscious teams.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.3/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription (Team-based).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $900/mo; Realistic: $7,000/mo; Optimistic: $25,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires using the official SDKs for various secret management services (e.g., AWS SDK, Vault API). The extension would need to securely store the access credentials for the vault itself (perhaps in the OS keychain) and then use them to fetch secrets.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a niche but high-value security tool. While some CLIs exist for this, a GUI integrated into VSCode would be a significant workflow improvement.

## Key Features
- Multi-Provider Support: Integrates with AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, and HashiCorp Vault.
- Read-Only Secret Browser: A panel to browse and view secrets the user has access to.
- Inject into Terminal: A button to inject the secrets as environment variables into a new integrated terminal session.
- Copy to Clipboard: Securely copy a secret's value to the clipboard (with an automatic clear after a short period).
- Team Configuration (Pro): Allow team leads to share vault configurations with the team.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active teams, and adoption by security-focused companies.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
