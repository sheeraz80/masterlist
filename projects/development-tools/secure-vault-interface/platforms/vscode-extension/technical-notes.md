# Secure Vault Interface - Vscode Extension Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. Requires using the official SDKs for various secret management services (e.g., AWS SDK, Vault API). The extension would need to securely store the access credentials for the vault itself (perhaps in the OS keychain) and then use them to fetch secrets.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An extension that provides a direct, read-only interface to a configured secrets manager. It allows developers to securely inject secrets into their local environment for a development session without ever writing them to disk.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use VS Code Extension API
- Node.js runtime environment
- Limited UI customization options
- Extension host process limitations

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
