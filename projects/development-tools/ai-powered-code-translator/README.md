# AI-Powered Code Translator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers sometimes need to understand or convert code written in a language they are not familiar with. Manually translating logic from Python to JavaScript, for example, is slow and error-prone.

**Solution:** A browser extension that works on sites like GitHub, GitLab, and Stack Overflow. A developer can highlight a block of code, and the AI will translate it to a different programming language, adding comments to explain the translation.

**Target Users:** Software developers, students learning new languages, and teams migrating codebases.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.3/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $16,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is a specialized application of an LLM. The extension sends the highlighted code and the target language to an AI API with a prompt like, "Translate this Python code to idiomatic JavaScript. Add comments explaining any parts where the logic differs significantly between the languages."

## Competition Level
Medium. AI chatbots like ChatGPT can perform this task if prompted correctly. The value of the extension is the seamless workflow integration, removing the need to copy-paste code back and forth.

## Key Features
- Multi-Language Translation: Supports translation between major languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, and Rust.
- Idiomatic Code: The AI is prompted to generate code that follows the conventions of the target language, not just a literal translation.
- Explanatory Comments: The translated code includes comments explaining the conversion.
- Side-by-Side Diff Viewer: Shows the original and translated code next to each other with changes highlighted.
- Framework-Aware Translations (Pro): A premium feature to translate code between similar frameworks (e.g., a React component to a Vue component).

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales and positive feedback from developers on the quality of the translations.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
