# Focus Flow

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Knowledge workers and students struggle with procrastination and digital distractions from sites like social media, news, and YouTube. Simple site blockers can be too rigid and easily bypassed.

**Solution:** An intelligent focus tool that combines a site blocker with a Pomodoro timer and ambient sounds. Users can create "focus sessions" that block a list of distracting sites for a set period.

**Target Users:** Students, writers, developers, and anyone who works online and struggles with focus.

## Quality Score

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $3,500/mo; Optimistic: $9,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The site-blocking functionality can be implemented using the API. The Pomodoro timer is simple client-side JavaScript. Ambient sounds are played from a library of included audio files.

## Competition Level
High. Many focus extensions like StayFocusd and Momentum exist. The opportunity is to create a more holistic and aesthetically pleasing experience by combining the three key elements (blocker, timer, sounds) into one seamless package.

## Key Features
- Session-Based Blocking: Block custom lists of distracting websites for a defined period (e.g., 25 minutes).
- Integrated Pomodoro Timer: A built-in timer to structure work and break intervals.
- Ambient Sound Library: A selection of background sounds (rain, coffee shop, white noise) to help with concentration.
- "Lockdown" Mode: A strict mode that prevents the user from changing the blocklist or stopping the session early.
- Productivity Stats: Simple charts showing total focus time and sessions completed per day/week.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume, high ratings in the Chrome Web Store, and user testimonials about improved focus and productivity.
