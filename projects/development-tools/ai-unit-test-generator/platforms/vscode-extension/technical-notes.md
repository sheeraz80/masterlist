# AI Unit Test Generator - Vscode Extension Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10. This is a challenging AI application. It requires excellent prompt engineering to make an AI model understand the function's logic, identify edge cases (e.g., null inputs, empty arrays), and generate syntactically correct test code with meaningful assertions. The user would provide their own AI API key.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An AI-powered extension that analyzes a selected function and automatically generates a complete unit test file for it, using a testing framework like Jest, PyTest, or Go's testing package.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use VS Code Extension API
- Node.js runtime environment
- Limited UI customization options
