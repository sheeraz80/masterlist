# AI Unit Test Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Writing unit tests is essential but often feels repetitive and time-consuming. Developers spend a lot of time writing boilerplate code to test simple functions and edge cases.

**Solution:** An AI-powered extension that analyzes a selected function and automatically generates a complete unit test file for it, using a testing framework like Jest, PyTest, or Go's testing package.

**Target Users:** Developers across all languages who want to speed up their testing workflow.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.2/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 4/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $10,000/mo; Optimistic: $40,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
7/10. This is a challenging AI application. It requires excellent prompt engineering to make an AI model understand the function's logic, identify edge cases (e.g., null inputs, empty arrays), and generate syntactically correct test code with meaningful assertions. The user would provide their own AI API key.

## Competition Level
Medium. GitHub Copilot can assist with writing tests, and dedicated tools like EarlyAI are emerging. The opportunity is to create a tool that is laser-focused on generating complete, high-coverage test files with one click, rather than just suggesting lines of code.

## Key Features
- One-Click Test Generation: Right-click a function and generate a corresponding test file.
- Multi-Framework Support: Supports popular testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, PyTest, and Go's native testing.
- Edge Case Detection: AI attempts to generate tests for common edge cases, not just the "happy path."
- Mock Generation: Automatically generates mock data and mock functions for dependencies.
- Configurable Assertions: Allow users to guide the AI on what aspects of the output to assert.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales, user adoption, and testimonials about significant time savings in the testing cycle.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
