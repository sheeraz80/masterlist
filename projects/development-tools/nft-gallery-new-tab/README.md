# NFT Gallery New Tab

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** NFT collectors own beautiful and expensive digital art, but it often just sits in their wallet, unseen. They lack a simple, elegant way to display and enjoy their collection as part of their daily routine.

**Solution:** A new tab replacement extension that displays a rotating gallery of the NFTs from a user's connected wallet(s), turning every new tab into a personal art exhibition.

**Target Users:** NFT collectors, digital art enthusiasts, and members of NFT communities.

- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $6,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The user provides their public wallet address(es). The extension uses an NFT API (like Blockmate or Covalent) to fetch the metadata and image URLs for the NFTs in the wallet. The new tab page is a simple HTML/CSS/JS page that displays these images.

## Competition Level
Low. While some Web3 browsers like Opera have NFT galleries, a dedicated new tab extension for this purpose is a unique and appealing idea.

## Key Features
- Personal NFT Gallery: Displays a random NFT from the user's collection every time they open a new tab.
- Multi-Wallet Support: Aggregate and display NFTs from multiple wallets (e.g., an Ethereum hot wallet and a Solana hardware wallet).
- Customization: Users can choose to display NFTs from specific collections, filter by traits, or set a specific NFT as a permanent background.
- Link to Marketplaces: Clicking on an NFT provides quick links to its page on OpenSea or Magic Eden.
- Aesthetic Layouts (Pro): A premium version with multiple layout options and themes for the new tab page.

## Success Indicators
Number of Pro purchases, daily active users, and social shares.
