# Recurring Task & Subscription Manager Widget - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Notion's databases are great for one-off tasks, but they lack a native way to handle recurring tasks (e.g., "Pay rent every 1st of the month") or manage subscriptions. Users rely on manual duplication or complex, brittle workarounds.

### Target Market
All Notion users, from individuals to business teams.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. This is a highly requested feature that Notion has not built. A few third-party solutions exist but are not widely known. A reliable widget would be very valuable.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 900/mo
- **Realistic:** 7,000/mo
- **Optimistic:** 25,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A subscription model is necessary to cover the ongoing server costs of the scheduling service. Pricing: Pro Plan ($5/month) for unlimited recurring tasks. A free tier could offer up to 5 recurring tasks. Acquisition: This would be a viral product within the Notion community. Marketing on Twitter, Reddit, and to Notion influencers would be highly effective.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: The backend scheduler must be extremely reliable. If it fails, users will lose trust. Platform Risk: Notion could build this feature natively at any time, making the widget obsolete.
