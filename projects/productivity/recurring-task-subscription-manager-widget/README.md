# Recurring Task & Subscription Manager Widget

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Notion's databases are great for one-off tasks, but they lack a native way to handle recurring tasks (e.g., "Pay rent every 1st of the month") or manage subscriptions. Users rely on manual duplication or complex, brittle workarounds.

**Solution:** An embeddable widget that connects to a Notion database and automatically creates recurring tasks based on user-defined schedules (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly on the 15th).

**Target Users:** All Notion users, from individuals to business teams.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 4/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Notion Templates](./platforms/notion-templates/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $900/mo; Realistic: $7,000/mo; Optimistic: $25,000/mo.

## Development Time
7+ days.

## Technical Complexity
7/10. Requires a robust backend service with a scheduler (like a cron job) to run daily. The service would use the Notion API to check for tasks that need to be created and add them to the user's specified database.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a highly requested feature that Notion has not built. A few third-party solutions exist but are not widely known. A reliable widget would be very valuable.

## Key Features
- Simple Setup: Connect to your Notion account and select your main task database.
- Flexible Scheduling: Create recurring tasks with schedules like "every Monday," "the last Friday of every month," or "every 3 days."
- Automatic Creation: The widget's backend service automatically adds the new task to your Notion database on the correct day.
- Subscription Tracking: Can also be used to manage recurring bills and subscriptions, creating a new entry in a "Bills" database each month.
- Management Dashboard: A simple web interface to view and manage all your recurring task rules.

## Success Indicators
MRR, active subscriber count, and becoming the "go-to" solution for recurring tasks in Notion.
