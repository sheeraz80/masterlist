# Competitor Ad Copy Analyzer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Marketers need to understand their competitors' messaging to position their own products effectively. Manually analyzing competitor websites and ads to distill their value proposition is a subjective and time-consuming research task.

**Solution:** An AI tool where a user inputs a competitor's landing page URL. The tool scrapes the key copy (headlines, sub-headlines) and uses Jasper to analyze the messaging, identify the core value proposition, and generate counter-arguments or alternative positioning for your own ads.

**Target Users:** Product marketers, competitive intelligence analysts, and startup founders.
