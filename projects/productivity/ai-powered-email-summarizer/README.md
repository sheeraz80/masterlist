# AI-Powered Email Summarizer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Professionals often receive long email threads and don't have time to read through the entire history to get up to speed. This is a major productivity drain, especially in fast-moving projects.

**Target Users:** Project managers, executives, sales teams, and anyone dealing with high email volume.
