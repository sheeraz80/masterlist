# Freelancer Client Portal Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Freelancers struggle to manage client communication, project deliverables, feedback, and invoicing in an organized way. Using email, Slack, and separate file-sharing services creates confusion and makes it hard for clients to see project progress in one place.

**Solution:** A clean, professional, and duplicatable Notion template that freelancers can use to create a dedicated, private portal for each client, centralizing all project-related information.

**Target Users:** Freelance designers, developers, writers, and consultants.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $4,500/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. Relies on well-structured databases for projects, tasks, deliverables, and invoices. The core of the work is in the UI/UX design of the portal to ensure it's intuitive for non-Notion users (the clients).
