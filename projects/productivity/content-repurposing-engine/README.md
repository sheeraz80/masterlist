# Content Repurposing Engine

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Content marketers and social media managers need to create a constant stream of content for different platforms. Manually adapting a single blog post into a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn article, and an email newsletter is a repetitive and time-consuming task.

**Solution:** An AI tool that takes a single piece of content (blog post, article) and automatically generates a complete set of repurposed assets for various social media platforms, tailored to each platform's tone and format.

**Target Users:** Content marketers, social media managers, and small business owners.

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,500/mo; Realistic: $12,000/mo; Optimistic: $50,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The user provides a URL. The extension scrapes the article content and sends it to an LLM API with a series of carefully engineered prompts to generate the different content formats (e.g., "Create a 5-tweet thread based on this article," "Write a professional LinkedIn post summarizing these key points").

## Competition Level
