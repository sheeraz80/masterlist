# Podcast Show Notes Automator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Podcasters want to publish detailed show notes to accompany their episodes for SEO and listener convenience, but creating a summary, listing key topics with timestamps, and writing guest bios is a time-consuming post-production task.

**Solution:** An AI tool that takes a podcast transcript (or an audio file), and uses Jasper to automatically generate comprehensive show notes, including a summary, a bulleted list of key takeaways, clickable topic timestamps, and a short bio for any guests mentioned.

**Target Users:** Podcasters, podcast production agencies, and content marketers.

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $3,500/mo; Optimistic: $10,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires an integration with a speech-to-text API if handling audio directly. The core is a multi-step Jasper workflow that processes the transcript to identify topics, speakers, and key points.

## Competition Level
Medium. Audio transcription services like Descript and are adding AI summary features. The niche is a tool that creates a complete, ready-to-publish show notes document, not just a transcript summary.

## Key Features
- Full Show Notes Generation: Creates a complete document with summary, key topics, and guest bios.
- Timestamp Detection: AI identifies topic changes in the conversation and creates clickable timestamps.
- Guest Bio Generation: If a guest introduces themselves, the AI pulls that information into a concise bio.
- Key Takeaway Bullets: Generates a bulleted list of the most important points for easy scanning by the reader.
- Customizable Template: Users can define the structure and formatting of their show notes.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit pack sales and podcasters using the generated show notes on their websites.
