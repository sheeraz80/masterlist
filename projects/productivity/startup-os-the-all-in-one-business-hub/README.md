# Startup OS: The All-in-One Business Hub

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Early-stage startups juggle numerous functions—product roadmapping, fundraising, marketing, and HR—often using a messy combination of spreadsheets, documents, and disparate tools. This leads to information silos, wasted time, and a lack of a single source of truth for the entire team.

**Solution:** A comprehensive, integrated Notion template that serves as the central operating system for a startup, connecting everything from company goals and investor relations to project management and employee onboarding.

**Target Users:** Startup founders, small business owners, and early-stage teams (1-20 people).
