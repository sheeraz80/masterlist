# Task Management Pro (GTD)

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While the Tasks plugin is powerful, users who follow specific productivity methodologies like Getting Things Done (GTD) have to manually configure complex workflows. There is no out-of-the-box solution for a full GTD system in Obsidian.

**Solution:** A template and plugin bundle that provides a complete, pre-configured GTD system. It includes dashboards for Inbox, Next Actions, Projects, and Someday/Maybe lists, all powered by the Tasks and Dataview plugins.

**Target Users:** Productivity enthusiasts and followers of the Getting Things Done methodology.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. This is less about new code and more about expert-level configuration of existing plugins (Tasks, Dataview, QuickAdd). The value is in the pre-built dashboards, queries, and workflow automation.

Medium. Many users share their own GTD setups, but a polished, easy-to-install "pro" version would be attractive to those who don't want to spend hours on configuration.
