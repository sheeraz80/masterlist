# Social Media Feed Blocker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users often need to access social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn for specific tasks (e.g., checking messages, posting an update) but get sucked into the endless scroll of the news feed, destroying productivity.

**Solution:** A simple extension that blocks the main feed on social media sites while still allowing access to other parts of the site like messages, profiles, and notifications.

**Target Users:** Professionals, students, and anyone looking to use social media more intentionally.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 9/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Free (with a "Buy Me a Coffee" link).

## Revenue Potential
N/A (focus on user adoption and goodwill).

## Development Time
2-3 days.

## Technical Complexity
2/10. This is very simple to implement. It uses a content script with a simple CSS rule to hide the specific feed element on each supported site (e.g., div[data-testid="primaryColumn"] { display: none!important; }).

## Competition Level
Low. While general site blockers are common, a targeted "feed blocker" is a more nuanced solution that solves a very specific, common pain point.

## Key Features
- One-Click Toggle: Easily enable or disable the feed blocker from the extension's popup.
- Multi-Site Support: Works on major social media platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram).
- Whitelist Timer: A "Take a Break" button that temporarily disables the blocker for a set time (e.g., 15 minutes).
- Customizable: Advanced users can add their own CSS selectors to block elements on other sites.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users, positive reviews, and mentions in productivity blogs and articles.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
