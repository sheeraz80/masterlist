# Writer's Longform Studio

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While Obsidian is excellent for notes, writers working on long-form projects like novels or screenplays struggle to manage structure, character arcs, and word count goals. They often resort to specialized software like Scrivener, fragmenting their workflow.

**Solution:** An all-in-one plugin that provides a dedicated "writing mode" and toolset for long-form projects, including a manuscript outliner, character and location trackers, and integrated writing goals.

**Target Users:** Novelists, screenwriters, and non-fiction authors.

## Quality Score

- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $3,500/mo; Optimistic: $10,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin would use custom views and data from frontmatter to organize files. It doesn't require external APIs. The main complexity is in designing an intuitive UI that consolidates all the writing tools in one place.

## Competition Level
Medium. The Longform plugin is popular and provides a solid foundation. The opportunity is to create a more comprehensive "studio" experience with more features specifically for creative writing, such as character relationship mapping and plot structure templates.

## Key Features
- Manuscript View: A dedicated view that compiles scenes/chapters into a single, scrollable manuscript.
- Character & Location Database: Use notes with specific tags (e.g., #character) to create a database of all characters, tracking their arcs and appearances.
- Writing Goals & Sprints: Set word count goals for the project, chapter, or a timed writing sprint (Pomodoro-style).
- Plot Structure Templates: Templates for common narrative structures like the "Three-Act Structure" or "The Hero's Journey."
- Distraction-Free Mode: A full-screen, typewriter-style writing mode that hides all UI elements.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and positive reviews from authors who have completed projects using the plugin.

## Additional Information
