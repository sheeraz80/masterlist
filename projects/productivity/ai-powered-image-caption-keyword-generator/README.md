# AI-Powered Image Caption & Keyword Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Photographers, bloggers, and social media managers need to write descriptive captions and relevant keywords for their images to improve engagement and SEO. This is a creative but often time-consuming task.

**Target Users:** Social media managers, bloggers, photographers, and content creators.

Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $4,500/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension sends the image URL or data to a multimodal LLM API (like GPT-4o or Gemini) that can understand image content. The prompt would ask the AI to perform the specific tasks of generating captions, alt text, and keywords.

## Competition Level
Low. While some AI writers can generate captions from a text prompt, a tool that works directly from an image in the browser is a more direct and intuitive workflow.

## Key Features
- Image-to-Caption: AI analyzes the image and generates several engaging caption options.
- Tone & Style Options: Generate captions in different tones (e.g., humorous, inspirational, descriptive).
- SEO Keyword Generation: Provides a list of relevant keywords for the image.
- Alt Text Generation: Creates descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.
- Hashtag Suggestions: Suggests relevant and trending hashtags to accompany the image on social media.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales, number of images analyzed, and user shares of the generated content.
