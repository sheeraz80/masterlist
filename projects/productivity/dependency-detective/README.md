# Dependency Detective

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** In modern development, projects accumulate dozens or even hundreds of dependencies. It's difficult to visualize the entire dependency tree, identify unused packages, or spot security vulnerabilities without external tools, which breaks the development workflow.

**Solution:** An extension that scans the (or , etc.) and creates an interactive dependency graph, highlighting unused packages, circular dependencies, and known security vulnerabilities.

**Target Users:** All software developers, especially those working on large or legacy projects, and security-conscious teams.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $9,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The core logic involves parsing the project's dependency file. For vulnerability scanning, it would integrate with a free API like the Google OSV Scanner. The dependency graph can be rendered in a webview panel using a JavaScript library like .

## Competition Level
Medium. The Import Cost extension shows package sizes, but not a full dependency tree or vulnerabilities. Some CLI tools exist, but an integrated VSCode extension provides a much better user experience.

## Key Features
- Interactive Dependency Graph: A visual, zoomable graph of all project dependencies and their relationships.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Flags packages with known security vulnerabilities by cross-referencing with a public vulnerability database.
- Unused Package Detection: Analyzes import statements in the codebase to identify packages that are listed in but are no longer used.
- License Information: Displays the license type for each package, helping teams stay compliant.
- One-Click Updates (Pro): A button to automatically run the command to update an outdated or vulnerable package.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user reviews praising its security insights and cleanup capabilities.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
