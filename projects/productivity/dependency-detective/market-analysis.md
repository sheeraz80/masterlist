# Dependency Detective - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
In modern development, projects accumulate dozens or even hundreds of dependencies. It's difficult to visualize the entire dependency tree, identify unused packages, or spot security vulnerabilities without external tools, which breaks the development workflow.

### Target Market
All software developers, especially those working on large or legacy projects, and security-conscious teams.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. The Import Cost extension shows package sizes, but not a full dependency tree or vulnerabilities. Some CLI tools exist, but an integrated VSCode extension provides a much better user experience.

### Competitive Landscape

- **Optimistic:** 9,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A freemium model where core analysis is free, and advanced/automated features are paid. Monetization can be handled via a service like ExtensionPay or a custom license key system. Tiers: Free: Full dependency graph and vulnerability scanning. Pro ($5/month or $49/year): Unused package detection, license compliance checks, and one-click update actions. Acquisition: Target developers on platforms like Hacker News and Reddit. Write articles on "managing your node_modules folder" or "supply chain security for developers."

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
API Dependency: Relies on external vulnerability databases. If the API changes or becomes unavailable, a core feature is impacted. Performance Risk: Analyzing very large projects with thousands of dependencies could be slow. The analysis needs to be optimized to run efficiently.

### Key Risks
