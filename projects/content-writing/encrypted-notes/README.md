# Encrypted Notes

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Obsidian's local-first nature is great for privacy, but some users want an extra layer of security to encrypt specific sensitive notes (e.g., journals, financial information, passwords) within their vault.

**Solution:** A plugin that allows a user to encrypt the content of a specific note with a password. The note's content is unreadable without the password, even if the vault files are compromised.

**Target Users:** Privacy-conscious users, journalists, and anyone storing sensitive information in their vault.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.0/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $7,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin would use a standard, well-vetted JavaScript encryption library (like AES from crypto-js). The core logic involves taking the note's content, encrypting it with a user-provided password, and replacing the note's content with the encrypted ciphertext.

## Competition Level
Low. The Meld Encrypt plugin exists but is not widely known. A well-marketed and easy-to-use encryption plugin would be very popular.

## Key Features
- Note-Level Encryption: Encrypt individual notes with a unique password.
- Strong Encryption: Uses industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- In-Editor Decryption: When a user opens an encrypted note, a password prompt appears. Entering the correct password decrypts and displays the content for that session.
- Auto-Lock: Automatically re-encrypts the note when it's closed or after a period of inactivity.
- Frontmatter Exclusion: Keeps the note's frontmatter (metadata) unencrypted so it can still be used by plugins like Dataview.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and becoming the trusted solution for encryption in Obsidian.
