# PDF++ Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The PDF++ plugin allows for PDF annotation within Obsidian, which is a huge step forward. However, it lacks advanced features like extracting highlighted text into a separate summary note or searching across all annotations in the vault.

**Solution:** A "pro" version or companion to PDF++ that adds advanced research features. It allows users to extract all highlights from a PDF into a new Markdown note and provides a global search function for all PDF annotations across the entire vault.

**Target Users:** Researchers, students, and anyone who works extensively with PDF documents.
