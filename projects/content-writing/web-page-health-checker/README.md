# Web Page Health Checker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users, especially non-technical ones, have no easy way to check a webpage for common issues like broken links, missing images, or basic SEO problems.

**Target Users:** Website owners, content managers, junior SEOs, and QA testers.

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $8,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension's content script would parse the DOM of the current page to find all links and images. It then makes fetch requests to check the status of each link and image URL. SEO data is extracted directly from the page's HTML.

## Competition Level
Medium. Full-featured SEO extensions like MozBar and SEOquake are powerful but can be overwhelming for beginners. The niche is simplicity and focusing on a few key, actionable "health check" metrics.

## Key Features
- Broken Link Checker: Scans all links on the page and flags any that return a 404 error.
- Image Alt-Text Audit: Lists all images that are missing descriptive alt text, which is important for accessibility and SEO.
- On-Page SEO Summary: Displays the page's title tag, meta description, and H1/H2 structure.
- Simple Report: Presents the findings in a clean, easy-to-understand report with options to export as a CSV.
- Scheduled Scans (Pro): Ability to schedule automatic scans of key pages and receive email reports.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user reviews from small business owners.
