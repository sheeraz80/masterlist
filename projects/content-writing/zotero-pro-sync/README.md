# Zotero Pro Sync

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Researchers rely on Zotero for reference management, but the process of getting citation data and annotations into Obsidian can be clunky. Existing plugins offer basic import but lack deep, two-way synchronization.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a deep, two-way sync between Zotero and Obsidian. It creates and updates literature notes in Obsidian from Zotero entries, and syncs highlights and annotations made on PDFs in either application.

**Target Users:** Academics, researchers, and graduate students.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $6,000/mo; Optimistic: $20,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires using the Zotero API and potentially a Zotero plugin on the other end to facilitate the two-way sync. The logic for matching and updating annotations without creating duplicates is the main challenge.

## Competition Level
Medium. The Citations and other Zotero-related plugins exist, but a true two-way sync for annotations is a "holy grail" feature for many academic users.

## Key Features
- Automatic Literature Note Creation: Creates a new note in Obsidian for each new entry in a selected Zotero collection, populated with metadata.
- Two-Way Annotation Sync: Highlights and notes made on a PDF in Zotero appear in the corresponding Obsidian note, and vice-versa (using a companion Zotero plugin).
- Customizable Templates: Use Templater syntax to define exactly how literature notes and imported annotations should be formatted.
- Citation Management: Easily insert properly formatted citations into any note from your Zotero library.
- Offline Caching: Syncs changes even when one of the applications is offline, resolving them when both are back online.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and testimonials from researchers about their streamlined workflow.
