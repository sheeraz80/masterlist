# Team Collaboration Toolkit

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While Obsidian is primarily a single-user tool, small teams want to use it for collaborative knowledge management. The official Sync service allows for vault sharing, but lacks real-time collaboration features like seeing other users' cursors or commenting.

**Solution:** A plugin that adds real-time, Google Docs-style collaboration to Obsidian notes, allowing multiple users to edit the same note simultaneously.

**Target Users:** Small teams in startups, research labs, and creative agencies.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.3/10

### Score Breakdown

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $900/mo; Realistic: $8,000/mo; Optimistic: $30,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
Building a stable, performant, real-time collaboration engine is a massive technical undertaking. Market Risk: Competing with established collaborative tools like Notion or Google Docs is difficult. The target is teams who are deeply committed to Obsidian's local-first, Markdown-based philosophy.

## Competition Level
Low. The Relay plugin is a runner-up for this, but the space is not mature. This is a highly desired feature that solves a major gap in Obsidian's capabilities for teams.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Multi-user Editing: See other users' cursors and edits appear in real-time.
- Commenting & Mentions: A comment system where users can highlight text and @-mention teammates.
- Version History: A clear, visual history of who changed what and when.
- Presence Indicators: See who else is currently viewing or editing a note.
- End-to-End Encryption: All communication between clients is encrypted, ensuring privacy.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active teams, and becoming the standard for team collaboration in Obsidian.

## Additional Information
