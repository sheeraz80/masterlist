# Customer Review to Testimonial Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Marketing teams know that customer testimonials are powerful social proof, but collecting them and editing them into compelling copy is a manual process. Raw reviews are often too long, poorly written, or not focused on the key benefits.

**Solution:** A tool that scrapes a company's positive reviews from platforms like G2, Capterra, or Trustpilot and uses Jasper to automatically draft several polished, impactful testimonial snippets for use on a website or in marketing materials.

**Target Users:** SaaS marketers, e-commerce managers, and product marketing teams.
