# Simple Upvote/Like Button Widget

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creators who use Notion to publish content (like blog posts or public wikis) have no way to gauge audience engagement. They can't see if readers find a page useful or interesting, as there's no native "like" or "upvote" button.

**Solution:** A simple, embeddable widget that adds a "Like" or "Upvote" button to any public Notion page. It tracks the number of clicks and displays the count, providing a simple form of social proof and feedback.

**Target Users:** Bloggers, writers, and businesses using Notion as a public-facing CMS.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $200/mo; Realistic: $1,000/mo; Optimistic: $3,000/mo.
