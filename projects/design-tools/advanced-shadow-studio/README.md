# Advanced Shadow Studio

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Figma's default drop shadow effect is basic and often looks flat and unrealistic. Creating soft, nuanced, multi-layered shadows requires stacking multiple effect layers manually, which is cumbersome and difficult to manage.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a simple, intuitive interface for creating beautiful, realistic shadows by manipulating a virtual "light source" or using presets for layered, colored shadows.

**Target Users:** UI designers, icon designers, and anyone looking to add depth and polish to their designs.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.2/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The plugin doesn't create a new type of effect; it programmatically generates and manages a stack of standard Figma drop shadow effect layers. The UI would have a simple draggable "light source" that calculates the x, y, blur, and spread for multiple shadow layers to create a smooth, diffused effect.

## Competition Level
Low to Medium. The Beautiful Shadows plugin is popular and proves the demand for this. The opportunity is to create a "Pro" version with more controls, presets, and advanced features like colored shadows.

## Key Features
- Light Source Control: A draggable point in the UI that controls the angle and distance of the shadow.
- Layered Shadows: Automatically generates multiple, stacked shadow layers with varying opacity and blur to create a soft, realistic look.
- Color Control: Ability to set a custom color for the shadow, which is then applied with varying transparency across the layers.
- Preset Library: A collection of pre-designed shadow styles (e.g., "Soft & Subtle", "Sharp & Dramatic", "Material UI Key/Ambient").
- Save Custom Presets: Users can save their own shadow configurations to reuse across projects.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume, positive user reviews comparing it favorably to the free alternative, and its use in popular UI kits.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
