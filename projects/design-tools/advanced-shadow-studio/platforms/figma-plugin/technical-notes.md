# Advanced Shadow Studio - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10. The plugin doesn't create a new type of effect; it programmatically generates and manages a stack of standard Figma drop shadow effect layers. The UI would have a simple draggable "light source" that calculates the x, y, blur, and spread for multiple shadow layers to create a smooth, diffused effect.
