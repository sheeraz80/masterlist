# Grid Guardian

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Maintaining a consistent spacing and grid system (e.g., an 8-point grid) is fundamental to good UI design, but it's easy for inconsistencies to creep into large projects. Manually measuring every element's position and size is not feasible.

**Solution:** A plugin that scans a selection or the entire page for elements whose dimensions (width, height) or positions (x, y) are not multiples of a specified grid unit (e.g., 8px), highlighting them and offering an auto-fix option.

**Target Users:** UI/UX designers, front-end developers, and design system teams focused on pixel-perfect implementation.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $1,500/mo; Optimistic: $4,000/mo.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. The logic is straightforward: traverse selected nodes, get their x, y, width, and height properties, and check if they are divisible by the user-defined grid unit using the modulo operator. The main work is in creating a clear UI to display the results.

## Competition Level
Low. While many designers talk about grid systems, few plugins exist to actively enforce them. This is a niche but important utility for professional designers.

## Key Features
- Customizable Grid Unit: User can set any grid unit (e.g., 4, 8, 10).
- Scan Selection/Page: Option to check only selected layers or the entire current page.
- Visual Highlighting: Draws a red outline around any element that violates the grid rule.
- Auto-Fix: A button to automatically round the dimensions and position of a violating element to the nearest grid unit.
- Ignore List: Ability to tag certain elements to be ignored during scans.

## Success Indicators
Total number of sales, high ratings in the Community, and mentions in design blogs and tutorials about best practices.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
