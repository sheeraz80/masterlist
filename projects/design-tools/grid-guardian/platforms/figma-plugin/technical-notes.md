# Grid Guardian - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 3/10. The logic is straightforward: traverse selected nodes, get their x, y, width, and height properties, and check if they are divisible by the user-defined grid unit using the modulo operator. The main work is in creating a clear UI to display the results.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 3-4 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that scans a selection or the entire page for elements whose dimensions (width, height) or positions (x, y) are not multiples of a specified grid unit (e.g., 8px), highlighting them and offering an auto-fix option.
