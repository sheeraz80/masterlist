# Grid Guardian - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Maintaining a consistent spacing and grid system (e.g., an 8-point grid) is fundamental to good UI design, but it's easy for inconsistencies to creep into large projects. Manually measuring every element's position and size is not feasible.

### Target Market
UI/UX designers, front-end developers, and design system teams focused on pixel-perfect implementation.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. While many designers talk about grid systems, few plugins exist to actively enforce them. This is a niche but important utility for professional designers.

### Competitive Landscape
