# FigTask (Integrated Task Lists) - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Design teams often juggle external project management tools for tracking design to-dos, which means leaving Figma to check tasks or update statuses. Minor tasks (like “fix padding here” or “replace image”) may be noted in comments or separate tools and get lost. There’s no lightweight way in Figma to keep a checklist of design tweaks or tasks linked to the design itself.

### Target Market
In-house design teams and freelance designers collaborating with clients – anyone who wants to track design-specific tasks without heavy project management overhead. Especially useful for solo designers or small teams that find full Jira tickets overkill for minor design fixes.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low – There isn’t a well-known Figma plugin for task management; most teams use external tools. Some plugins exist to send frames to Jira or GitHub, but nothing that acts as a simple internal checklist to our knowledge. The novelty is integrating tasks into the design context. So competition is mainly the inertia of existing processes (some might say “just use Asana”). We’ll position it as complementary, not a full PM replacement.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
Freemium. Free for individual use with basic checklist features. A paid version (perhaps $5/month per user or a one-time $25) adds integrations (sync tasks to external PM tools) and team collaboration (shared task lists for a Figma file that multiple editors can check off). Another angle: monetize through the Figma Community as a paid plugin once that’s open (or via our website with license keys).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $200/month; Realistic: $800/month; Optimistic: $2,500/month. This is somewhat niche (many might just use existing PM tools), but given Figma’s large user base, even a fraction adopting for convenience can bring steady income. The optimistic case might involve a few teams adopting at scale for internal workflows.

### Monetization Strategy
Market to freelance and small agency designers as a productivity booster: “stay in flow without switching apps to track minor tweaks.” Use social media and Figma community to showcase how it keeps design reviews organized. For teams using Jira, emphasize the integration (Pro feature) that can save duplicating effort (some designers hate navigating Jira for small things). Customer acquisition could involve offering the free version widely and prompting upgrade if they want multi-user sync or integration. Pricing is kept low to encourage impulse buys for convenience.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Adoption risk: Some might not adopt because they already have a tool; we address this by focusing on ease and integration (no extra effort to log tasks – just jot it in plugin and carry on). Platform: Minimal risk; using Figma’s allowed storage means data stays with the file. If Figma changes plugin data API, we’d adjust. Technical: If doing external sync, there’s a risk in handling API keys/tokens – we’ll store them securely in client and not on a server. The integration might break if external APIs change, but that’s maintainable. Market: If Figma introduces native simple to-dos or if another free plugin emerges, it could threaten us. We’ll aim to build a userbase quickly and possibly incorporate user suggestions to stay ahead.

### Key Risks
- Platform dependency risk
- Competition risk
- Technical implementation risk
- Market adoption risk
- Revenue sustainability risk

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify across multiple platforms
- Focus on unique value proposition
- Maintain technical excellence
- Build strong user community
- Develop sustainable revenue streams

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Platform user base size
- Market segment size
- Growth potential

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- Targetable user subset
- Geographic limitations
- Platform-specific constraints

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

- Resource limitations

## Success Indicators
Number of active files using the task lists (we could count tasks created); qualitative feedback like “I never forget a feedback point now, it’s all in one place”; conversion rate to Pro for those who want integration; and potentially reduced context-switching as reported by users (harder to measure, but testimonials). Also, tracking if teams adopt it widely (e.g. multiple users on the same file using it, which we can see via task updates).
