# FigTask (Integrated Task Lists) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Inline task panel: A sidebar in Figma listing tasks; tasks can have a name, optional description, and a link to a specific frame or layer (clicking the task could select/highlight that element)
- Checkboxes and statuses: Mark tasks as done, which greys them out or hides them; maybe support simple status tags (to-do, in progress, done) for clarity
- File-based storage: Tasks are saved within the Figma file’s plugin data so anyone opening the file with the plugin sees the same task list (enabling collaboration without a server)
- Export/Sync (Pro): Option to export tasks to a JSON or sync with a Trello board or Jira (each task becoming a card/ticket). Could also import tasks from those sources to display in Figma.
- Notifications: (If feasible without a server) Possibly alert when a task assigned to you in Figma is checked off or updated – though without a backend, this might be limited to just visual cues when you open the file.
