# FigTask (Integrated Task Lists) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 3/10 – The UI and storage are simple. The main complexity is if we implement external sync (auth flows for APIs like Trello/Jira) – but that can be gated to Pro. A purely internal version is very simple. Ensuring tasks persist and possibly are shareable with team (Figma plugin data is per file and accessible to all editors of that file, so that’s doable). No server needed; integration calls go directly from client to external APIs if used.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. Basic checklist UI is straightforward with Figma plugin UI APIs (React could be used). Storing tasks can be done in the Figma document memory (plugin data saved with file) or localStorage. Integrations (like writing to Trello/Jira via their REST APIs) add a day or two if included. AI is not particularly needed here aside from maybe assisting code.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that adds a simple to-do or task list panel within the Figma canvas. Designers can create tasks linked to specific frames or elements (e.g. “Revise header color on Screen 3”) and check them off as they work. It’s like sticky note to-dos inside Figma, eliminating the need to switch to an external tracker for small iterative tasks. Optionally, it can sync with popular tools (Trello, Jira) via their APIs if desired, but primarily it’s zero-backend (storing tasks in the Figma file or local storage).

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
