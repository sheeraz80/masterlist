# FigTask (Integrated Task Lists) - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
In-house design teams and freelance designers collaborating with clients – anyone who wants to track design-specific tasks without heavy project management overhead. Especially useful for solo designers or small teams that find full Jira tickets overkill for minor design fixes.

### Revenue Model
Freemium. Free for individual use with basic checklist features. A paid version (perhaps $5/month per user or a one-time $25) adds integrations (sync tasks to external PM tools) and team collaboration (shared task lists for a Figma file that multiple editors can check off). Another angle: monetize through the Figma Community as a paid plugin once that’s open (or via our website with license keys).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $200/month; Realistic: $800/month; Optimistic: $2,500/month. This is somewhat niche (many might just use existing PM tools), but given Figma’s large user base, even a fraction adopting for convenience can bring steady income. The optimistic case might involve a few teams adopting at scale for internal workflows.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Market to freelance and small agency designers as a productivity booster: “stay in flow without switching apps to track minor tweaks.” Use social media and Figma community to showcase how it keeps design reviews organized. For teams using Jira, emphasize the integration (Pro feature) that can save duplicating effort (some designers hate navigating Jira for small things). Customer acquisition could involve offering the free version widely and prompting upgrade if they want multi-user sync or integration. Pricing is kept low to encourage impulse buys for convenience.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
