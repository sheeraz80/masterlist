# Design System Linter Pro - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Comprehensive Linter: Detects layers using colors, fonts, strokes, or effects not defined in the local styles or variables library.
- Spacing & Layout Audit: Flags elements that do not adhere to a predefined grid system (e.g., 8pt grid) or have inconsistent padding within Auto Layout frames.
- One-Click Correction: A "Fix All" button that intelligently applies the closest matching style or variable to all offending layers, dramatically speeding up cleanup.
- Custom Rule Sets: A premium feature allowing teams to define their own linting rules, such as disallowing font sizes below a certain pixel value or enforcing specific naming conventions for layers.
- Ignore List: Ability to mark specific layers or frames to be ignored by the linter, providing flexibility for experimental design work.
