# Design System Linter Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Design teams at agencies and large companies struggle to maintain visual consistency across extensive Figma files. Deviations from the established design system (rogue colors, non-standard fonts, incorrect spacing) lead to brand dilution, technical debt, and friction during developer handoff. Manually auditing files is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

**Solution:** An automated linter that scans the entire Figma file for any elements that deviate from the defined local styles and variables, providing a comprehensive report and one-click fixes.

**Target Users:** In-house design teams, design system managers, and design agencies managing multiple client projects.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription (SaaS-like model).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $750/mo; Realistic: $7,500/mo; Optimistic: $30,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. Requires proficient use of the Figma Plugin API to traverse the entire document node tree, access properties of each layer, and compare them against the file's local styles and variables. The UI can be a simple panel listing errors and fix buttons.

## Competition Level
Medium. Free tools like Design Lint exist but are limited in scope and lack automated fixing capabilities. Paid competitors often focus on a single aspect (e.g., only accessibility or only variables). The unique value is in creating a comprehensive, all-in-one "janitor" tool with powerful automation.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive Linter: Detects layers using colors, fonts, strokes, or effects not defined in the local styles or variables library.
- Spacing & Layout Audit: Flags elements that do not adhere to a predefined grid system (e.g., 8pt grid) or have inconsistent padding within Auto Layout frames.
- One-Click Correction: A "Fix All" button that intelligently applies the closest matching style or variable to all offending layers, dramatically speeding up cleanup.
- Custom Rule Sets: A premium feature allowing teams to define their own linting rules, such as disallowing font sizes below a certain pixel value or enforcing specific naming conventions for layers.
- Ignore List: Ability to mark specific layers or frames to be ignored by the linter, providing flexibility for experimental design work.

## Success Indicators
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), number of active subscriptions, conversion rate from free to paid tier, and weekly number of "linting actions" performed by the plugin.
