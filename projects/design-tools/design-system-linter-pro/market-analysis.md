# Design System Linter Pro - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Design teams at agencies and large companies struggle to maintain visual consistency across extensive Figma files. Deviations from the established design system (rogue colors, non-standard fonts, incorrect spacing) lead to brand dilution, technical debt, and friction during developer handoff. Manually auditing files is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

### Target Market
In-house design teams, design system managers, and design agencies managing multiple client projects.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Free tools like Design Lint exist but are limited in scope and lack automated fixing capabilities. Paid competitors often focus on a single aspect (e.g., only accessibility or only variables). The unique value is in creating a comprehensive, all-in-one "janitor" tool with powerful automation.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 750/mo
- **Realistic:** 7,500/mo
- **Optimistic:** 30,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A freemium model using Figma's native payment system for a frictionless upgrade path. Tiers: Free: Scan one page at a time, manual fixes only, max 3 custom rules. Pro Team ($49/month per team): Unlimited file scanning, "Fix All" automation, unlimited custom rules, and shared team configurations. Acquisition: Content marketing (blog posts on "Maintaining Design System Hygiene"), promotion in Figma communities on Reddit and Discord, and a robust free version to drive word-of-mouth adoption.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Platform Risk: High dependency on the stability and feature set of the Figma Plugin API. A major breaking change could require significant rework. Mitigation involves active participation in the Figma developer community to stay ahead of changes. Market Risk: Figma could eventually build a more robust native linting tool. Mitigation is to move quickly, build a loyal user base, and focus on advanced, pro-level features that Figma is unlikely to prioritize.
