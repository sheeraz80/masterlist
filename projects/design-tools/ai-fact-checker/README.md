# AI Fact-Checker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** In an era of misinformation, it's difficult for readers to quickly verify claims made in online articles, social media posts, or blog content. Manually searching for sources for every claim is impractical.

**Solution:** A browser extension that allows a user to highlight any statement on a webpage. The AI then scours the web for reputable sources (news articles, research papers) to either support or contradict the claim, providing a "confidence score" and links to the evidence.

**Target Users:** News consumers, students, researchers, and anyone concerned with media literacy.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium (with a potential for donations).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension sends the highlighted text to an LLM with a prompt like, "Search for academic papers and reputable news sources that either verify or debunk this statement." The AI would need to be fine-tuned or heavily prompted to prioritize high-authority sources and provide a balanced view.

## Competition Level
Low. While fact-checking organizations exist, a real-time, in-browser AI tool for this purpose is a novel concept. Tools like Perplexity can be used for this, but this would be a purpose-built tool for the task.

## Key Features
- Highlight to Fact-Check: Select any claim and get an instant analysis.
- Source-Backed Analysis: The AI provides a summary of its findings along with direct links to the supporting or refuting sources.
- Confidence Score: Displays a simple score indicating the AI's confidence in the claim's validity based on the sources found.
- Bias Detection (Pro): A premium feature that analyzes the language of the source article for potential political or commercial bias.
- Crowdsourced Feedback: Users can rate the quality of the AI's fact-checks to help improve the system.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users, quality and neutrality of the fact-checks, and partnerships with educational bodies.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
