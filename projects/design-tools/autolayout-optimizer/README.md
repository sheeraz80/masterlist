# AutoLayout Optimizer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Figma’s Auto Layout is powerful but many designers struggle to set it up optimally. They often spend time tweaking padding, alignment, or rebuilding frames to be responsive. Misconfigured layouts lead to inconsistent spacing and extra rework.

**Solution:** A plugin that analyzes a selected frame or group and automatically applies the best-practice Auto Layout settings. It could suggest improvements like consistent padding, proper distribution, or wrapping settings to make the frame responsive. Essentially an “Auto Layout wizard” to save time and ensure uniform UI structure.

**Target Users:** UI/UX designers (especially less experienced ones) and design teams who frequently use Figma Auto Layout for responsive design and want to speed up that setup.

**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-time purchase per user (e.g. $20 per license via Gumroad or Figma Community). Given this is a productivity booster, a modest one-time fee might be attractive. Alternatively, a small subscription ($3-$5/month) for continuous updates and advanced features could work if there’s ongoing improvement (but one-time is simpler).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/month; Realistic: $1,500/month; Optimistic: $5,000/month. This assumes steady sales of ~25 to 250 copies monthly, which is feasible given Figma’s user base and the broad appeal of layout automation.

## Development Time
~5 days. The logic involves reading frame properties and child elements, then applying Figma’s Auto Layout properties programmatically. With AI assistance, we can derive heuristic rules (e.g. equal spacing detection) quickly.

## Technical Complexity
3/10 – Uses straightforward Figma API manipulations. Key tasks: measure current spacing/margins, detect patterns (like all items equally spaced but not using auto layout), then apply appropriate settings. Edge cases (nested auto layouts) require careful handling but are manageable. No external integrations required.

## Competition Level
Low – While many tutorials and some plugins exist to help with Auto Layout, there is no widely used “optimizer” tool. Figma’s own features are manual. Thus, competition is primarily manual workflow or partial solutions (like Figma’s built-in tidy feature which is limited). We have a first-mover advantage in this niche.

## Key Features
- Layout analysis: Inspect a frame to determine if children are evenly spaced, aligned, etc., and detect if Auto Layout isn’t used where it could be
- One-click optimize: Apply Auto Layout to a selected frame with recommended padding, spacing, and alignment (e.g. uniform gaps, proper resizing mode)
- Suggestions panel: If a frame already has Auto Layout, highlight suboptimal settings (like inconsistent padding) and suggest fixes (e.g. “Set all padding to 16px”)
- Responsive preview: Show how the optimized layout behaves when resized, so users trust the changes
- Undo/Compare: Easily revert to original or toggle between before/after to ensure the user is comfortable with the modifications

## Success Indicators
Number of licenses sold; user reviews/ratings on Figma Community (high ratings would validate its value); engagement metrics like how many frames optimized per user; support inquiries (fewer issues reported indicates robustness); and perhaps community buzz (e.g. being listed in “top Figma plugins” lists).

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** Yes
