# AutoLayout Optimizer - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Layout analysis: Inspect a frame to determine if children are evenly spaced, aligned, etc., and detect if Auto Layout isn’t used where it could be
- One-click optimize: Apply Auto Layout to a selected frame with recommended padding, spacing, and alignment (e.g. uniform gaps, proper resizing mode)
- Suggestions panel: If a frame already has Auto Layout, highlight suboptimal settings (like inconsistent padding) and suggest fixes (e.g. “Set all padding to 16px”)
- Responsive preview: Show how the optimized layout behaves when resized, so users trust the changes
- Undo/Compare: Easily revert to original or toggle between before/after to ensure the user is comfortable with the modifications
