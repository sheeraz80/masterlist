# AutoLayout Optimizer - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
UI/UX designers (especially less experienced ones) and design teams who frequently use Figma Auto Layout for responsive design and want to speed up that setup.

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase per user (e.g. $20 per license via Gumroad or Figma Community). Given this is a productivity booster, a modest one-time fee might be attractive. Alternatively, a small subscription ($3-$5/month) for continuous updates and advanced features could work if there’s ongoing improvement (but one-time is simpler).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/month; Realistic: $1,500/month; Optimistic: $5,000/month. This assumes steady sales of ~25 to 250 copies monthly, which is feasible given Figma’s user base and the broad appeal of layout automation.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Market on the Figma Community and social media with before-and-after examples showing how designs become cleaner instantly. Since it’s a one-time purchase, emphasize lifetime value (free updates). Possibly partner with design influencers to review it. Support and updates can be a selling point (which free scripts lack). Use user testimonials quantifying time saved per screen to convince buyers.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
