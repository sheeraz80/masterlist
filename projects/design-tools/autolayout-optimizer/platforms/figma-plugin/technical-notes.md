# AutoLayout Optimizer - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 3/10 – Uses straightforward Figma API manipulations. Key tasks: measure current spacing/margins, detect patterns (like all items equally spaced but not using auto layout), then apply appropriate settings. Edge cases (nested auto layouts) require careful handling but are manageable. No external integrations required.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. The logic involves reading frame properties and child elements, then applying Figma’s Auto Layout properties programmatically. With AI assistance, we can derive heuristic rules (e.g. equal spacing detection) quickly.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that analyzes a selected frame or group and automatically applies the best-practice Auto Layout settings. It could suggest improvements like consistent padding, proper distribution, or wrapping settings to make the frame responsive. Essentially an “Auto Layout wizard” to save time and ensure uniform UI structure.
