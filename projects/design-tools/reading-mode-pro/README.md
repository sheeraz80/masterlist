# Reading Mode Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Many websites, especially news sites and blogs, are cluttered with ads, pop-ups, and distracting sidebars, making it difficult to read articles. While some browsers have a built-in reader mode, it's often basic and not available on all sites.

**Solution:** A highly customizable reading mode extension that works on any article-based webpage. It extracts the main content and displays it in a clean, readable, and configurable format.

**Target Users:** Avid readers, researchers, and anyone who wants a cleaner, more focused online reading experience.
