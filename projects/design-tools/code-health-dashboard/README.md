# Code Health Dashboard

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** It's hard to get a quick, objective measure of the quality or "health" of a codebase. Metrics like code complexity, duplication, and comment density are often hidden in separate static analysis tools.

**Solution:** A dashboard panel in VSCode that provides a real-time "health score" for the current file and the overall project, based on configurable code quality metrics.

**Target Users:** Technical leads, senior developers, and teams focused on maintaining high code quality.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $8,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires parsing the code (using ASTs) to calculate metrics like cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity, and lines of code. The UI would be a webview panel displaying the scores and charts.

## Competition Level
Low. While linters like ESLint catch errors , they don't typically provide high-level, aggregated quality metrics in a dashboard format. This tool is about insight, not just rule enforcement.

## Key Features
- Project Health Score: An overall score (0-100) for the project based on a weighted average of various metrics.
- Key Metrics Display: Shows metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, comment ratio, and TODO/FIXME count.
- Historical Trends (Pro): A chart showing how the project's health score has changed over time with each commit.
- Configurable Thresholds: Set custom warning and error thresholds for each metric.
- File-Level Insights: View a detailed health report for the currently open file.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro teams, and adoption by companies known for high engineering standards.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
