# Code Health Dashboard - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
It's hard to get a quick, objective measure of the quality or "health" of a codebase. Metrics like code complexity, duplication, and comment density are often hidden in separate static analysis tools.

### Target Market
Technical leads, senior developers, and teams focused on maintaining high code quality.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. While linters like ESLint catch errors , they don't typically provide high-level, aggregated quality metrics in a dashboard format. This tool is about insight, not just rule enforcement.

### Competitive Landscape

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 500/mo
- **Realistic:** 2,500/mo
- **Optimistic:** 8,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: Freemium. The real-time dashboard for the current project state is free. Historical trend analysis and advanced configuration are paid features. Tiers: Free: Dashboard with key metrics for the current project state. Pro ($10/month per team): Historical trend charts, custom metric weighting, and PDF report exporting. Acquisition: Target engineering managers and advocates of "clean code." Write blog posts explaining the different code quality metrics and their importance.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: Accurately and performantly calculating complex metrics across a large codebase is challenging. Market Risk: The value of these metrics might be seen as too academic by some teams. The tool needs to clearly demonstrate how these metrics lead to better, more maintainable code.

### Key Risks
