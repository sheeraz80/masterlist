# Twitter (X) Power Tools

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Twitter's native web interface lacks features for power users, such as advanced filtering, thread creation, and analytics.

**Solution:** A suite of tools that enhances the Twitter web experience, adding features like a "focus mode" to hide the algorithmic timeline, an advanced tweet composer for threads, and basic analytics on your own tweets.

**Target Users:** Social media managers, content creators, journalists, and Twitter power users.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This involves significant DOM manipulation of the Twitter website via content scripts. The thread composer would be a custom UI that then uses Twitter's backend APIs (which may require reverse-engineering if official ones are not available/sufficient) to post the tweets in sequence.

## Competition Level
Medium. Tools like TweetDeck (now a paid Twitter feature) and other third-party clients have historically filled this gap. An extension that enhances the native site is a compelling alternative.

## Key Features
- Focus Mode: Hide the main "For You" feed, mentions, and notifications to focus on lists or search.
- Advanced Thread Composer: A dedicated UI for writing and scheduling long threads, with auto-numbering.
- Personal Tweet Analytics: Adds a small analytics summary (views, engagement rate) directly below your own tweets.
- Advanced Mute: Mute keywords, hashtags, and even specific users from your timeline more effectively than the native tools.
- Download Video: A simple button to download videos from tweets.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and reliance on the tool by well-known Twitter power users.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
