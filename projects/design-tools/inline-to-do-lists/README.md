# Inline To-Do Lists

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While the Tasks plugin is great for managing a global task list, users often want simple, localized checklists within a specific note (e.g., a packing list in a travel plan, or sub-tasks for a meeting note) without the overhead of the full Tasks syntax.

**Solution:** A lightweight plugin that enhances Obsidian's native checklists, adding features like progress bars, quick-move buttons, and a summary of completed/total items for any checklist within a note.

**Target Users:** All Obsidian users who use checklists for simple task management.
