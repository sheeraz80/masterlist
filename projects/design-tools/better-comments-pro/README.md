# Better Comments Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The popular Better Comments extension helps organize comments by color-coding them based on prefixes like *, !, ?, and TODO. However, it lacks features for managing and navigating these annotations.

**Solution:** An enhanced version of Better Comments that not only color-codes comments but also provides a dedicated sidebar panel to view all special comments in the project, grouped by type, and allows for custom comment types.

**Target Users:** All developers, especially those working in teams or on large projects.
