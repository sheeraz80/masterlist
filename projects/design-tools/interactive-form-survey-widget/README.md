# Interactive Form & Survey Widget

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Notion is great for storing information, but its native forms are basic and lack advanced features like conditional logic, multi-page layouts, or custom styling. Users who need to collect structured data from others often have to use external tools like Google Forms or Typeform and then manually import the data.

**Solution:** An embeddable widget that allows users to build beautiful, advanced forms that feed data directly into a Notion database via the API.

**Target Users:** Businesses, researchers, event planners, and anyone who needs to collect data from an audience and manage it in Notion.
