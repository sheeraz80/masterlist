# BrandGuard Pro - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Enterprise and agency design teams managing strict brand standards, as well as brand managers who want an automated way to guard design consistency.

### Revenue Model
Subscription licensing for organizations – e.g. $50/month for a team up to 10 editors, scaling by team size. The plugin could offer a 14-day free trial for companies to prove its value.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: ~$1,500/month; Realistic: ~$5,000/month; Optimistic: ~$15,000/month, given a handful of large enterprise clients (who stand to save costly rework) could justify higher pricing.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Offer tiered plans – e.g. Basic (1 brand, up to 5 editors) vs. Enterprise (multiple brand profiles, unlimited editors). Pricing can be justified by the cost of brand inconsistencies (lost time and redoing work). Acquisition via direct outreach to design teams (highlighting that brand inconsistency “eats up time and drains momentum”) and showcasing case studies where the plugin prevented costly mistakes.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
