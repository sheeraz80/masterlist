# BrandGuard Pro - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10 – Needs to maintain a database of allowed style tokens (colors, fonts, logos). Checking each element in real-time could be performance-intensive, so we’ll implement on-demand scans or selective monitoring. No external servers; guidelines can be stored as JSON in the Figma file or uploaded by the user.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Core features (style checks) are straightforward using Figma APIs; additional time for UI and testing with sample brand libraries. AI assistance can help build the rules engine for detecting “off-brand” usage.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that actively enforces brand guidelines. It alerts designers in real-time if they use non-approved colors, fonts, or logo variations and offers the correct on-brand asset or style. Essentially a “brand police” inside Figma to prevent guideline violations.
