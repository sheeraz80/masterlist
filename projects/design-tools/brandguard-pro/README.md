# BrandGuard Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Ensuring brand consistency across designs is a top challenge for 83% of design teams. Designers often inadvertently use off-brand colors, fonts, or logos, especially under tight deadlines or in large teams.

**Solution:** A Figma plugin that actively enforces brand guidelines. It alerts designers in real-time if they use non-approved colors, fonts, or logo variations and offers the correct on-brand asset or style. Essentially a “brand police” inside Figma to prevent guideline violations.

**Target Users:** Enterprise and agency design teams managing strict brand standards, as well as brand managers who want an automated way to guard design consistency.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.5/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription licensing for organizations – e.g. $50/month for a team up to 10 editors, scaling by team size. The plugin could offer a 14-day free trial for companies to prove its value.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: ~$1,500/month; Realistic: ~$5,000/month; Optimistic: ~$15,000/month, given a handful of large enterprise clients (who stand to save costly rework) could justify higher pricing.

## Development Time
~7 days. Core features (style checks) are straightforward using Figma APIs; additional time for UI and testing with sample brand libraries. AI assistance can help build the rules engine for detecting “off-brand” usage.

## Technical Complexity
5/10 – Needs to maintain a database of allowed style tokens (colors, fonts, logos). Checking each element in real-time could be performance-intensive, so we’ll implement on-demand scans or selective monitoring. No external servers; guidelines can be stored as JSON in the Figma file or uploaded by the user.

## Competition Level
Medium – There are some solutions like Frontify and Ethos that integrate brand assets into Figma, but those focus on providing libraries rather than real-time enforcement. Few plugins proactively warn users of guideline breaches. This unique focus keeps direct competition low, though internal design ops tools may exist at big companies.

## Key Features
- Live style validation: Instant alert (e.g. red outline) on any element using a non-approved color or font, with suggestions from the approved palette
- Asset replacement: Detects if an outdated logo or icon is used and offers the latest official asset from the brand library
- Brand library sync: Import official brand guidelines (colors, typography, logos) into the plugin for reference
- Reporting: One-click report of all off-brand occurrences in a page or file for review
- Guideline updates: Easy update mechanism when brand standards change (so all team members’ plugins update rules automatically)

## Success Indicators
Reduction in brand guideline violations per design (measured via plugin reports); adoption rate within a client (e.g. % of team members actively using the plugin); number of brand profiles managed in the plugin; average revenue per customer (signs that larger orgs are subscribing); qualitative feedback from brand managers about time saved in reviews.
