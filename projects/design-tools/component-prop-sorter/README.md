# Component Prop Sorter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** As Figma components become more complex with dozens of variants and properties, the property panel can become a disorganized mess. This makes it difficult for designers to quickly find and toggle the right property, slowing down the design workflow.

**Solution:** A one-click utility that automatically sorts the properties of a selected component set alphabetically or based on a custom user-defined order.

**Target Users:** Design system creators, UI engineers, and designers working with complex component libraries.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Free (with a "Buy Me a Coffee" link).

## Revenue Potential
N/A (focus on building reputation and as a lead magnet for other paid plugins).

## Development Time
2-3 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. Requires using the Figma API to get the component set definition and its properties, reordering the property array, and then updating the component definition. The main challenge is ensuring the reordering doesn't corrupt the component.

## Competition Level
Very Low. This is a quality-of-life utility that solves a minor but persistent annoyance for power users. Few, if any, plugins address this specific issue.

## Key Features
- One-Click Sort: Select a component and click "Sort Properties" to instantly organize them alphabetically.
- Custom Order: An advanced feature allowing users to drag-and-drop properties into a desired order in the plugin's UI.
- Sort All: A command to apply the sorting logic to all components in the current file.

## Success Indicators
Number of installs, positive reviews, and community engagement. Success is measured in reputation and brand building rather than direct revenue.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
