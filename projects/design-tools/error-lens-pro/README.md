# Error Lens Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The built-in error highlighting in VSCode is good, but it can be subtle. The popular Error Lens extension improves this by showing errors inline, but it could be enhanced with more context and AI-powered suggestions.

**Solution:** A "pro" version of the error lens concept. It not only displays the error inline but also provides an AI-powered "Explain this error" button and suggests possible fixes.

**Target Users:** All developers, from beginners to experts.

## Quality Score

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension would use the VSCode Diagnostics API to get error information from the linter. It would then send the error message and the relevant code snippet to an AI API to get an explanation or a suggested fix.

## Competition Level
High. Error Lens is a very popular and free extension. The value proposition must come from the AI-powered enhancement.

## Key Features
- Inline Error Display: Displays linter errors and warnings directly on the line of code.
- AI Error Explanation (Pro): A button that sends the error to an AI to get a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation of what the error means.
