# Crypto Social Sentiment Tracker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The price of crypto assets, especially smaller ones, is heavily influenced by social media sentiment. Traders need a way to quickly gauge the "hype" around a token on platforms like Twitter and Telegram.

**Solution:** An extension that analyzes social media sentiment for a given crypto asset. When browsing a token on a site like CoinGecko, it shows a "sentiment score" based on the volume and tone of recent mentions on Twitter.

**Target Users:** Crypto traders, especially those focused on "memecoins" and narrative-driven assets.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $6,000/mo; Optimistic: $20,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires using the Twitter API to search for mentions of a specific token ($CASHTAG). An LLM API is then used to perform sentiment analysis on the collected tweets. This requires a backend to handle the data collection and analysis.

## Competition Level
Medium. Some paid crypto analytics platforms like Messari offer sentiment analysis. An affordable, integrated browser tool is a strong niche.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Sentiment Score: A simple score (e.g., -100 to +100) indicating the current sentiment for a token.
- Mention Volume Chart: A chart showing the number of Twitter mentions over the last 24 hours.
- Key Influencer Mentions: Highlights recent tweets about the token from major crypto influencers.
- Custom Alerts (Pro): A premium feature to get notifications when a token's sentiment score or mention volume spikes.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user reports of profitable trades made using the tool's data.
