# Web Page to Presentation

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating a presentation based on the content of a webpage or article is a manual process of copying text, summarizing points, and designing slides. This is a common task for students, researchers, and professionals who need to present information they've found online.

**Solution:** An AI-powered tool that takes any webpage URL, analyzes its content, and automatically generates a polished, multi-slide presentation (in Google Slides or PowerPoint format) summarizing the key information.

**Target Users:** Students, consultants, sales professionals, and marketers.

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension scrapes the content of the URL. An LLM is then used to structure the content into a logical presentation flow (e.g., Title, Introduction, Key Point 1, Key Point 2, Conclusion). Finally, it uses the Google Slides API or a library to programmatically create the presentation file with the generated content.

## Competition Level
Low. While AI presentation makers like exist, a tool specifically for the "webpage-to-deck" workflow is a unique and valuable niche.

## Key Features
- One-Click Presentation Generation: Paste a URL and get a downloadable presentation deck.
- Intelligent Content Structuring: AI identifies headings, key points, and images to create a logical slide structure.
- Multiple Template Styles: Users can choose from several professional design templates for their presentation.
- Editable Output: The generated presentation is fully editable in Google Slides or PowerPoint.
- Speaker Note Suggestions: AI generates draft speaker notes for each slide.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit pack sales, number of presentations generated, and user satisfaction with the quality of the output.
