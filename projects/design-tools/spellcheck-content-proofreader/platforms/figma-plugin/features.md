# SpellCheck+ (Content Proofreader) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Spell check all text: Scans every text node in selection or page, highlights unknown words.
- Review interface: Step through each flagged word with context (show the text in a snippet). Suggest common corrections (maybe using an algorithm like Levenshtein distance to nearest words in dictionary). User can click to replace the text in the layer or ignore it.
- Custom dictionary: Allow adding words to ignore (like brand names, jargon) so they aren’t flagged. Save this per file or globally for user.
- Grammar/punctuation (Pro): Highlight potential grammar issues like double spaces, mixed “...” vs “…”, or basic grammar patterns (like “an user” vs “a user”). Possibly integrate with an API for deeper grammar suggestions for Pro users.
- Language support: Option to check in different languages if the design is non-English (maybe through different dictionaries or an API call).
