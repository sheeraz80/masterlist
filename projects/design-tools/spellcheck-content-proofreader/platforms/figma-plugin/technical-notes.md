# SpellCheck+ (Content Proofreader) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10 – Checking large amounts of text can be slow in JS, but maybe okay unless the file is huge. An external API might be needed for robust suggestions, which raises complexity about network and API costs. Perhaps as MVP just identify likely misspellings (flag words not in dictionary) which covers most use cases. Multi-language detection is another complexity if we support non-English; maybe out of scope for now, or require user to pick language. The actual replacing of text is easy via Figma API. UI to review each issue is moderate complexity (like a little panel “Word X not found, suggestions:... [Replace] [Ignore]”).

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~6 days. For basic spell-check, we can use a dictionary approach: include a list of common words (maybe ~100k words dictionary which might be heavy to embed but possible) to check each text node. For suggestions, we might need an API (like some spellcheck API or use an open-source spellchecker lib). Grammar check likely requires an external service (like LanguageTool API) – possible if user consents. Ensuring privacy: perhaps do it offline where possible or allow opting in to online. UI to list found issues and apply fixes is needed. AI assistance could help integrate an open-source solution or with checking complexities.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that runs a spell check on all text layers in a Figma file (or selected frames) and flags potential spelling errors, grammar issues, or inconsistencies. It could use an offline word list for spell-check (for privacy) or call an API for advanced grammar suggestions. It highlights the words and offers suggestions to correct them (possibly auto-replacing the text in the layer if user confirms). Additionally, it can check for common design terminology consistency (maybe using a custom dictionary feature).
