# SpellCheck+ (Content Proofreader) - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Figma currently doesn’t have a built-in spell check or grammar check across all text, meaning typos can slip through in designs (embarrassing in client presentations or when copying text to production). Designers manually find/replace or rely on copy reviews, which isn’t always reliable. Also, checking consistency of terminology (e.g. “Login” vs “Log in”) is manual.

### Target Market
UI/UX designers, content designers, anyone working on text-heavy designs (dashboards, editorial content layouts, etc.) – especially those preparing deliverables for stakeholders where typos would undermine credibility. Also non-native English designers might find it useful to catch mistakes.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low – Surprising gap: I haven’t seen a popular spellcheck plugin for Figma; might be one but not well-known, and Figma itself doesn’t have it. So it’s mostly a greenfield. People have definitely complained about lack of spellcheck, so demand exists. We’d likely become quite popular if executed well (which could drive lots of free users, and some convert).

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
Freemium. Spell check basic functionality could be free (to gain wide adoption, as basic spell-check might be seen as a must-have utility). A Pro tier ($5/month or $30/year) could add grammar checking, custom dictionaries (company names, product terms), and multi-language support or auto-translate checks. The value-add features would entice companies or power users.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $250/month; Realistic: $1,000/month; Optimistic: $3,500/month. Many might grab the free version just for spellcheck. Converting to paid depends on how much they value advanced checks – possibly content design teams or agencies would pay to avoid mistakes. If we tapped even a small percentage of Figma’s millions of users for a few bucks, optimistic is possible. But realistically, maybe a few hundred paying users for the pro features.

### Monetization Strategy
Market to professionals who care about polish – e.g. “Avoid embarrassing typos in your designs.” Emphasize how a single typo can derail user testing or client reviews, making this a cheap insurance. The plugin free tier already provides essential value (like a basic safety net), and Pro upsell for those wanting thoroughness (like content designers who might budget for it). We could approach design blogs or do a launch on Product Hunt highlighting the novelty (design spellcheck). The conversion to Pro would bank on advanced features and perhaps an organizational usage (teams with style guides might adopt it and want custom dictionaries, etc.).

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
False positives/negatives: Spell checking isn’t perfect – might miss some or flag proper nouns. Mitigation: allow ignores and continuously improve dictionary. Possibly get user feedback on common false flags to update dictionary. Performance: For a huge file with thousands of text nodes, scanning might lag. We can limit to a page or allow partial scans to manage. API reliance: If we do grammar with an external API, need to handle downtime or API cost. Could restrict grammar to small text blocks or require manual trigger per text to minimize calls. Privacy: Sending text to external service might be sensitive (if designs contain confidential text). We must either do offline or clearly inform/ask user for those features. Basic spell check can be offline with open word lists, so that’s safe. Competition: If someone else releases a free plugin after seeing ours, they could undermine the monetization (but our head start and more features can keep us ahead). Also, if Figma itself decides to add spellcheck natively, that’d obviate it – but Figma hasn’t in years, so likely safe for now.

### Key Risks

- Targetable user subset
- Geographic limitations
- Platform-specific constraints

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- Realistic market capture
- Competitive positioning
- Resource limitations

## Success Indicators
Number of documents checked and issues fixed (impact delivered – could maybe internally count how many replacements done); user feedback like “caught a typo I’d overlooked” (priceless anecdotal evidence); adoption rate – this plugin could realistically get tens of thousands of downloads if free, which is a success even if only a small fraction pay. Another indicator: reduction of typo errors in final products for those teams (though hard to measure directly, we might infer if users keep using it and renew sub). Also being featured in Figma Community or by evangelists as a must-have plugin would be a big success sign.
