# Book Tracker Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While many users track their reading in Obsidian, creating a rich library with cover images, metadata, and progress tracking requires manual effort or clunky plugins.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a dedicated interface for managing your book library. Simply search for a book by title or ISBN, and the plugin automatically creates a new note for it, complete with cover image, author, publication date, and summary from the Google Books API.

**Target Users:** Avid readers, students, and researchers.
