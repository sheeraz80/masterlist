# Daily Dashboard

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users often want a single "homepage" to start their day, but building a useful dashboard in Obsidian requires complex Dataview queries and manual setup.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a pre-built, highly functional "Daily Dashboard" note. It automatically shows today's calendar events, due tasks, a weather widget, and a "On this day" feature that shows notes created on the same day in previous years.

**Target Users:** All Obsidian users, especially those focused on personal productivity.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
4/10. The plugin would use Dataview and Tasks queries behind the scenes. It would need to integrate with a weather API and the user's local calendar files (iCal).

## Competition Level
Medium. The Homepage plugin allows setting a specific note as a homepage, but this plugin provides the content for that page automatically.

## Key Features
- Zero-Configuration Dashboard: A beautiful and functional dashboard that works out of the box.
- Calendar Integration: Shows today's events from your local or Google Calendar.
- Task Aggregation: Displays all tasks due today from the Tasks plugin.
- Weather Widget: A simple widget showing the local weather.
- "On This Day" Flashback: Resurfaces notes and journal entries from the same date in past years to encourage reflection.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and becoming a "must-have" plugin for new users.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
