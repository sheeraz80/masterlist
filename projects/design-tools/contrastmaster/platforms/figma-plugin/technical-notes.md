# ContrastMaster - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 2/10 – Technically simple. Iterate through text nodes and shapes, compute contrast ratios between foreground text and its background color (requires determining background, which can be tricky if layered – but we can simplify by using the immediate parent fill or artboard color). The math and rule definitions for WCAG 2.1 (contrast ratio 4.5:1 for normal text etc.) are well-defined. Everything runs client-side.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~4 days. Contrast calculation is straightforward math (using relative luminance formulas). Implementing the scan across all frames and layers and a UI to display results is doable quickly. AI not needed except perhaps to suggest nearest compliant color (which can be done with algorithmic adjustments).

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that automatically checks the color contrast of all text (and other elements) against backgrounds and flags any that fail accessibility standards. It provides a clear pass/fail report and suggestions for accessible color alternatives from the design’s palette.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
