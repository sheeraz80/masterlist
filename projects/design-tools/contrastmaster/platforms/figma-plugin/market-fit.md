# ContrastMaster - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
UX designers, accessibility specialists, and product teams concerned with inclusive design – essentially anyone designing UIs who wants to easily catch and fix low-contrast elements to comply with accessibility guidelines.

### Revenue Model
Freemium. Free tier performs basic contrast checking (AA standard) on demand. A Pro tier (e.g. $5/month or $50/year per user) adds advanced features like checking against AAA standards, batch fixing suggestions, integration with design systems (ensuring all official colors have contrast combos), and continuous monitoring as you design.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: ~$300/month; Realistic: ~$1,200/month; Optimistic: ~$4,000/month. Accessibility is important but somewhat niche – growth might come as accessibility becomes a standard requirement (trending upward). A realistic scenario might be a few hundred paid users globally, including some organizations buying multiple seats.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
The target market (companies emphasizing accessibility) often have budget for tools – position Pro as a cheap insurance to avoid costly accessibility bugs. Market via accessibility communities and by referencing legal requirements (e.g. ADA compliance) to create urgency. Use content marketing: blog about common contrast mistakes and feature the plugin. Possibly list on Figma Community and accessibility resource sites. The free tier drives adoption; converting those who need stricter AAA compliance or team reporting features will drive revenue.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
