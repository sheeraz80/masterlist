# ContrastMaster - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Designers need to ensure text and UI elements meet accessibility contrast standards (WCAG), but manually checking color contrast across dozens of text layers is tedious. It’s easy to overlook low-contrast text, leading to accessibility issues.

### Target Market
UX designers, accessibility specialists, and product teams concerned with inclusive design – essentially anyone designing UIs who wants to easily catch and fix low-contrast elements to comply with accessibility guidelines.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium – There are a couple of existing plugins for contrast (e.g. “Contrast” plugin) but they typically check one selection at a time. No major player dominates this, and many designers still do it manually or forget. Our edge is an automated full-document scan and suggestions, which is relatively unique.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
Freemium. Free tier performs basic contrast checking (AA standard) on demand. A Pro tier (e.g. $5/month or $50/year per user) adds advanced features like checking against AAA standards, batch fixing suggestions, integration with design systems (ensuring all official colors have contrast combos), and continuous monitoring as you design.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: ~$300/month; Realistic: ~$1,200/month; Optimistic: ~$4,000/month. Accessibility is important but somewhat niche – growth might come as accessibility becomes a standard requirement (trending upward). A realistic scenario might be a few hundred paid users globally, including some organizations buying multiple seats.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 300/month
- **Realistic:** 1,200/month
- **Optimistic:** 4,000/month

### Monetization Strategy
The target market (companies emphasizing accessibility) often have budget for tools – position Pro as a cheap insurance to avoid costly accessibility bugs. Market via accessibility communities and by referencing legal requirements (e.g. ADA compliance) to create urgency. Use content marketing: blog about common contrast mistakes and feature the plugin. Possibly list on Figma Community and accessibility resource sites. The free tier drives adoption; converting those who need stricter AAA compliance or team reporting features will drive revenue.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Compliance: We’re aiding compliance (accessibility) rather than raising concerns. Privacy: Not an issue – design content isn’t personal data and checks are local. Technical risks: Identifying the true background color of text might be complex in layered designs, but we can document limitations (like assume text’s immediate frame background). Also, staying updated if WCAG standards evolve. Market risk: If Figma adds native contrast warnings (they haven’t yet, but could in future given accessibility focus), it could reduce plugin demand. Mitigation: be the first and most comprehensive, and expand into related a11y checks (font size, touch target sizes, etc.).

### Key Risks
- Platform dependency risk
- Competition risk
- Technical implementation risk
- Market adoption risk
- Revenue sustainability risk

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify across multiple platforms
- Focus on unique value proposition
- Maintain technical excellence
- Build strong user community
- Develop sustainable revenue streams

## Success Indicators
Number of issues detected and fixed (the plugin could internally count “X issues resolved” – a metric to show impact); user adoption (especially in organizations or edu institutions); feedback from accessibility specialists; conversion rate from free to Pro (indicating our advanced features are valued); and possibly recognition in accessibility circles (e.g. recommended by accessibility blogs).
