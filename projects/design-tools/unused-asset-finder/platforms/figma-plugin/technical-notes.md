# Unused Asset Finder - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 3/10 – Listing and matching IDs is straightforward. Removing a style via plugin might not be directly possible (styles may require user action to delete if used; if truly unused, we might simulate deletion by creating an edit). For components, we can flag them for user to manually delete or possibly move them to a “Trash” page. Ensuring accuracy (not flagging something as unused when it is used) is important, but we can double-check references easily.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~4 days. The Figma plugin API can list all styles and components in a file and all nodes. We can cross-check usage by scanning nodes’ styleId/componentId references. Hidden or off-canvas layers can be found by checking layer visibility or coordinates. AI not needed; just careful iteration and matching.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that scans the Figma file for unused assets: it lists color styles and text styles that are defined but not applied to any object, components in the library or page that have 0 instances, and large images or layers that are hidden/off-canvas. It then offers the ability to highlight or remove these to clean up the file (with confirmation). Think of it as a “garbage collector” for Figma assets.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints

- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
