# Unused Asset Finder - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Design system managers and any designers dealing with legacy or team files who want to optimize and organize their Figma documents. Teams preparing a design system for publication or handoff will also benefit by removing cruft.

### Revenue Model
Freemium or one-time. Possibly freemium: free version identifies unused styles and components; Pro ($5 one-time or $2/month subscription) adds batch deletion and checks across multiple files (if we allow selecting a library file to scan usage in another). However, since Figma plugin scope is one file at a time, one-time purchase could suffice given it’s a straightforward utility.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $150/month; Realistic: $600/month; Optimistic: $1,500/month. This is a narrower utility, but every medium-to-large team likely faces this issue. Even if a few hundred designers globally pay a small fee, that’s within optimistic range. It might also attract one-off purchases when a need arises (spring cleaning of files).

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Market as a tool to optimize performance – cleaning file can reduce load times, which teams care about (especially if a file has too many unused assets causing slow Figma performance). Also a organization best practice: keeping a tidy design system. Share content (blog posts, tweets) showing “We cleaned a design file and reduced its size by 20%, here’s how.” The free version can show what’s unused (giving value), and users who want the convenience of auto-cleanup upgrade. Given the low price, impulse buys are likely if it saves an hour of manual cleaning. The plugin could also be mentioned in Figma community or at Config (Figma’s conference) if it gains traction.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
