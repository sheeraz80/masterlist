# Habit Tracker & Journaling Dashboard

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** People who want to build good habits and practice daily journaling often use separate apps for each. This fragmentation makes it difficult to see the connection between daily actions and overall mood or progress.

**Target Users:** Individuals focused on personal development, self-improvement, and mindfulness.
