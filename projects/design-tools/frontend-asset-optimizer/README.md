# Frontend Asset Optimizer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Large image and SVG assets can significantly slow down website load times. Developers often forget to manually compress these assets before committing them, leading to bloated production builds.

**Solution:** An extension that automatically optimizes images (JPG, PNG) and SVGs within the workspace. It can run on-demand or automatically on save.

**Target Users:** Front-end developers and web designers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.5/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/mo; Realistic: $1,200/mo; Optimistic: $3,500/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension would need to bundle or use WebAssembly versions of optimization libraries like mozjpeg for JPEGs, oxipng for PNGs, and svgo for SVGs. The logic would watch for file saves or be triggered by a command.

## Competition Level
Medium. There are many web-based tools and CLI tools for this (e.g., ImageOptim, SVGO). The value proposition is the automation and seamless integration into the VSCode workflow.

## Key Features
- Automatic Optimization on Save: Automatically compress image files when they are saved.
- Right-Click to Optimize: A context menu option to optimize a specific file or an entire folder.
- Configurable Quality Settings: Sliders to control the level of compression vs. quality for different file types.
- Optimization Report: Shows a summary of how much space was saved after an optimization run.
- Lossy and Lossless Options: Allow the user to choose between different optimization strategies.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and positive reviews from developers about improved site performance.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
