# Event Promotion Kit

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Marketing a webinar or online event requires creating a lot of promotional copy for different channels. Writing registration page copy, social media announcements, and reminder emails is a repetitive task for event marketers.

**Solution:** A simple Jasper workflow where the user inputs the event title, date, speaker names, and key topics. The tool then generates a complete promotional kit: landing page copy, a LinkedIn event description, a series of promotional tweets, and a "last chance to register" email.

**Target Users:** Event marketers, webinar producers, and community managers.
