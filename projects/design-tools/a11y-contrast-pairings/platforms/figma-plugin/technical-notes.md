# A11y Contrast Pairings - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10. The core logic involves reading color styles, iterating through every possible pair, calculating the WCAG contrast ratio for each pair using a standard formula (which can be implemented in client-side JavaScript), and then generating a visual grid in the plugin's UI or on the canvas.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 3-4 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that takes a designer's color palette (from local styles) and automatically generates a matrix of all possible text/background color pairings, clearly marking which ones pass WCAG AA and AAA contrast ratios.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
