# A11y Contrast Pairings - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Designers often struggle to find accessible (WCAG AA/AAA compliant) text and background color combinations from their brand's color palette. Manually checking each pair with a contrast checker is slow and inefficient, stifling creativity during the design process.

### Target Market
UI/UX designers, product designers, and any designer concerned with accessibility.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low to Medium. Plugins like Contrast and Stark check contrast for selected layers but do not proactively generate compliant pairings from a full palette. This tool is about discovery and system-building, not just validation.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $7,000/mo.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 600/mo
- **Realistic:** 3,000/mo
- **Optimistic:** 7,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A one-time purchase for a high-value utility. A price point of $19-$25 would be a no-brainer for designers who value accessibility and efficiency. Pricing: $25 one-time purchase. Acquisition: Post in accessibility-focused design communities (A11y groups), write articles on "Building an Accessible Color System in Figma," and partner with accessibility influencers for reviews.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: The WCAG contrast calculation formula must be implemented perfectly to be trustworthy. Any error would undermine the plugin's core value. Market Risk: Figma could enhance its native color picker to show contrast warnings, but it is unlikely to build a full palette-auditing tool like this.
