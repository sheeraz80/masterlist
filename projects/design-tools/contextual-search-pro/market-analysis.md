# Contextual Search Pro - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Researchers and knowledge workers frequently need to search for a highlighted term on a specific set of websites (e.g., a medical researcher searching PubMed, a developer searching Stack Overflow, a lawyer searching a legal database). The default "Search Google for..." is inefficient, requiring multiple steps to search on the desired site.

### Target Market
Researchers, developers, legal professionals, students, and anyone who performs repetitive searches on specific domains.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. A user on Reddit mentioned a similar, now-defunct extension they loved, indicating a clear user need. While some tools offer multi-search, a highly customizable context-menu-based tool is a niche that is not well-served.
