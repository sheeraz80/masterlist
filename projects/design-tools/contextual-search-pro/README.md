# Contextual Search Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Researchers and knowledge workers frequently need to search for a highlighted term on a specific set of websites (e.g., a medical researcher searching PubMed, a developer searching Stack Overflow, a lawyer searching a legal database). The default "Search Google for..." is inefficient, requiring multiple steps to search on the desired site.

**Solution:** A right-click context menu extension that allows users to instantly search a highlighted phrase on a pre-configured list of their favorite or most-used websites.

**Target Users:** Researchers, developers, legal professionals, students, and anyone who performs repetitive searches on specific domains.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $6,000/mo.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. Uses the API to add custom items to the right-click menu. The core logic involves constructing a search URL for the target site (e.g., https://..gov/?term=SEARCH_PHRASE) and opening it in a new tab.

## Competition Level
Low. A user on Reddit mentioned a similar, now-defunct extension they loved, indicating a clear user need. While some tools offer multi-search, a highly customizable context-menu-based tool is a niche that is not well-served.

## Key Features
- Customizable Search Engines: Users can add any website with a search function by providing the search URL format.
- Dynamic Context Menu: The right-click menu shows the user's configured list of search sites.
- Icon Support: Ability to add favicons next to each search engine in the menu for quick recognition.
- Import/Export: Users can back up and share their list of custom search engines.
- Grouped Searches: A premium feature to search a term across a group of sites simultaneously, opening each in a new tab.

## Success Indicators
Total number of sales, positive reviews focusing on time saved, and adoption within specific professional communities.
