# Localize Preview - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Product designers working on global products, localization teams reviewing design, and developers in international companies who want to ensure design accommodates all languages. Even designers in single-language context might use pseudo-expansion to ensure future-proofing.

### Revenue Model
Freemium. Free tier could allow pseudo-translation (like gibberish expansion) and maybe one target language (like Spanish). Pro tier ($8/month or so) unlocks multiple languages, actual machine translation integration (so meaningful phrases), and RTL support. Maybe team license if localization is a big focus (some companies might get multiple seats for all designers).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/month; Realistic: $1,200/month; Optimistic: $4,000/month. Many companies localize (I18n is a standard need). But not all designers actively test multiple locales at design time. This is more likely adopted in mature product orgs that ship in many countries. Optimistic if it becomes a standard practice for such orgs (some might integrate it into their design QA). If each of several big companies buys a few licenses, could add up.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Emphasize avoiding costly redesigns or bugs when entering other markets: “See before you build: will your UI break in German or Arabic?” Many PMs or engineering leads might encourage designers to use it as part of their process once aware. Could do content marketing linking to known examples of epic fails in localization (like text overflow causing UI issues in big apps). Provide some free value to get downloads (like pseudo and maybe Google Translate which is fairly good). Pro upsell for high-quality translations (DeepL, or support for many languages at once, or saving multiple localization states). Actually, maybe pro could allow exporting all text strings to a CSV for translators or something (though Figma has built CSV import plugins, but not sure about export built-in). That could be another bonus feature – bridging with localization workflow. Market on globalization forums or Slack (localization folks might love to push this onto design teams).
