# Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid) - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
When multiple designers collaborate or iterate on the same file, changes can override each other. Figma’s branching feature (for org accounts) addresses this, but many teams on lower plans lack a structured review for design changes. They often communicate via Slack or comments which can be messy. There’s no simple way to see what changed between two states of a design and approve merges (except manual comparison).

### Target Market
Design teams without Figma Organization (which has native branching) or even those with it but wanting a simpler quick review for small changes. Also design leads who want to ensure changes are reviewed. It could also help in design handoff to devs by highlighting what changed since last version (so devs know what to update).

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low – Figma’s own branching is the competition, but behind expensive plan. Some teams use abstracted process, but nothing direct in plugin form. So it’s somewhat unique. Main competitor is status quo (designers eyeballing differences or just trusting each other).

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
This is more niche, probably a one-time or small subscription aimed at teams. Maybe charge per team usage (like $50 one-time for a team pack or $5/user). But given it’s essentially a process tool, adoption might be limited to serious collaborative teams. Let’s say one-time per user $10 and perhaps multi-user discounts.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $100/month; Realistic: $400/month; Optimistic: $1,500/month. This is niche because larger teams might have branching or other tools, and small teams might not formalize reviews. But there is a middle ground (like mid-size companies on Figma professional plan) that could use it. If we tap those, optimistic scenario maybe a couple hundred users.

- **Conservative:** 100/month
- **Realistic:** 400/month
- **Optimistic:** 1,500/month

### Monetization Strategy
Aim at process-conscious teams: “Bring some git-like sanity to design changes without paying for Enterprise.” If any team has complained “I wish Figma branching was cheaper,” that’s our audience. We can find them on forums or Twitter complaining about lack of version control. The cost of a mistake (like implementing the wrong iteration or design inconsistencies) could be used as justification. Possibly approach design ops communities. However, as a smaller potential market, keep expectations modest and maybe combine with our Versioner plugin marketing. Could even consider bundling if we had multiple related tools.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Adoption: Many might just upgrade to organization for branching if they really need robust version control. Our plugin is a workaround; we must ensure it's not too cumbersome. If using plugin requires lots of steps, people might not bother. We mitigate by making it as simple as possible (maybe focusing on small changes rather than large divergent changes). Technical: Differences could be complex or plugin might mis-identify changes (need robust testing). If it misses something big, trust in the tool is lost. We'll focus on obvious differences. File structure: If someone rearranged layers massively, our diff may not align – we should possibly limit to frames with same structure or instruct how to do it (like duplicating a frame and editing inside it without renaming layers excessively so diff can match by layer ID or name). Provide best practice guide to maximize diff accuracy. Platform: No significant issues except plugin memory for storing snapshots (which could be large if capturing images of frames for visual diff). We could limit to textual diff for many changes, maybe optional visual diff (like create flattened images of each frame and do pixel compare if user requests – could be heavy). Perhaps skip pixel diff as it's heavy. Competition: If Figma ever includes a lite branching for teams or a better diff view, then plugin becomes less needed. But until then, we fill a gap.

## Success Indicators
If small teams (like 5-10 designers) adopt it and say it improved their workflow (“we caught differences easily, fewer miscommunications”), that’s a win. If we get even a handful of case studies, we can leverage that. Also, if plugin usage shows repeated comparisons, it means it's being integrated into their routine (like every PR in code, they do a design MR often). Over time, if such practice becomes common, maybe bigger adoption or Figma replicates it (in which case we influenced the product, which is still a sign of success albeit hurting plugin eventually).
