# Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid) - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Design teams without Figma Organization (which has native branching) or even those with it but wanting a simpler quick review for small changes. Also design leads who want to ensure changes are reviewed. It could also help in design handoff to devs by highlighting what changed since last version (so devs know what to update).

### Revenue Model
This is more niche, probably a one-time or small subscription aimed at teams. Maybe charge per team usage (like $50 one-time for a team pack or $5/user). But given it’s essentially a process tool, adoption might be limited to serious collaborative teams. Let’s say one-time per user $10 and perhaps multi-user discounts.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $100/month; Realistic: $400/month; Optimistic: $1,500/month. This is niche because larger teams might have branching or other tools, and small teams might not formalize reviews. But there is a middle ground (like mid-size companies on Figma professional plan) that could use it. If we tap those, optimistic scenario maybe a couple hundred users.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Aim at process-conscious teams: “Bring some git-like sanity to design changes without paying for Enterprise.” If any team has complained “I wish Figma branching was cheaper,” that’s our audience. We can find them on forums or Twitter complaining about lack of version control. The cost of a mistake (like implementing the wrong iteration or design inconsistencies) could be used as justification. Possibly approach design ops communities. However, as a smaller potential market, keep expectations modest and maybe combine with our Versioner plugin marketing. Could even consider bundling if we had multiple related tools.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
