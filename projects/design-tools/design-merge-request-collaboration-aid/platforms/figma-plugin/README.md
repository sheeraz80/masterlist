# Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid) - Figma Plugin

## Platform-Specific Implementation

### Overview
This implementation targets the **Figma Plugin** platform.

### Target Users
Design teams without Figma Organization (which has native branching) or even those with it but wanting a simpler quick review for small changes. Also design leads who want to ensure changes are reviewed. It could also help in design handoff to devs by highlighting what changed since last version (so devs know what to update).
