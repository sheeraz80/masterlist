# Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10 – Implementing a reliable diff for design layers is complex. Visual diff (like snapshot images pixel compare) could be easier but not precise for content changes. A simpler approach: traverse layer tree and find mismatches (text changed, layer moved by x px, color changed) and list them. That’s doable but needs careful recursion and tolerance for minor differences (like if a shadow changed or an auto-layout reflow slightly moved something). We can narrow to changes in properties we care about: position, size, fill, text content. It doesn’t have to catch every nuance (like if two icons swapped positions, though that would appear as two position changes). For merging, actually applying differences programmatically means we’d manipulate the original frame’s layers – possible but risk of messing up if structure diverged. Perhaps leave merge to user using our guidance. Focus on compare and summary.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Use design snapshot diff logic (from Project 12: Design Versioner) to show differences. Possibly integrate with some notification (like generate a markdown of changes that can be posted or copied to Slack). Actually notifying via plugin is hard unless we integrate with email/Slack API which would require user-provided webhook or minimal server involvement (maybe output text and user manually shares). Main heavy lifting: diffing two frames (which we've partly covered earlier). Also interface for “Propose change” and “Merge it” which essentially could mean copying changes over. If the frames are in same file, merging is basically replacing original content with new (we could copy over the changed layers). Or more simply, user manually merges after reviewing diff. We may not fully automate merge (to avoid messing up file). Could assist by selecting changed layers to quickly copy.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that emulates a “merge request” workflow for Figma designs. It could work by allowing a designer to mark a frame or page as a new version and compare it to an older snapshot (leveraging our earlier version snapshot logic from Project 12). It highlights differences and then could notify another user for review (maybe by generating a shareable summary of changes). While it can’t truly restrict merges without Figma’s branching, it offers structure: you can pseudo-“fork” (duplicate) a frame, modify it, then use the plugin to compare with original and if “approved”, replace the original with the new one. This facilitates a lightweight design review process.
