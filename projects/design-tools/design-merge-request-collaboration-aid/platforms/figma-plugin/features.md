# Design Merge Request (Collaboration Aid) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Snapshot and compare: Designer takes a "before" snapshot of a frame (or uses a baseline). After making changes (maybe on a copy of that frame or same frame – if same frame, we need an earlier snapshot; if on copy, we can diff copy vs original). The plugin generates a list of differences: e.g. “Text ‘Signup’ changed to ‘Sign Up’”, “Button color #0088FF -> #0077Ee”, “Image layer added”, “Icon moved +10px right”. Possibly also highlight these changes on the canvas (like drawing boxes around changed elements).
- Share changes: Provide a text summary or simple visual diff output (maybe snapshot images of before/after with highlights) that can be pasted into Slack or attached to an email for review. If we can’t directly integrate, we can at least copy text to clipboard or export a .png showing changes.
- Approval tracking: Not easy without a server, but we could allow adding a checkmark or comment in the file that someone approved. Perhaps just instruct to resolve by merging. Possibly integrate with Figma comments by adding a comment listing changes (but comments via plugin might not be allowed). Maybe simplest: after review, user clicks “Apply changes” and plugin replaces the original frame’s content with new one. Or if working on same frame with snapshots, just finalize that snapshot as new baseline. We can simulate an approval by marking in plugin that it's merged (for our reference) but that doesn’t persist globally.
- Merge assistance: If the design iteration was done on a separate frame, the plugin can automatically replace the old frame with the new one (or copy changed layers over) when approved, to avoid manual copy-paste errors. Essentially a one-click update original.
