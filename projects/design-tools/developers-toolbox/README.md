# Developer's Toolbox

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Web developers frequently need small utility tools like a JSON formatter, a color picker, a ruler for measuring elements, or a placeholder text generator. Using separate extensions for each clutters the toolbar and using web-based tools requires switching tabs.

**Solution:** An all-in-one extension that combines the most common web developer utilities into a single, convenient dropdown panel.

**Target Users:** Front-end developers, web designers, and QA testers.

## Quality Score

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $1,800/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. This is essentially a collection of smaller tools. Each tool (e.g., color picker, ruler) is its own small project. The complexity comes from integrating them all into a single, polished UI.

## Competition Level
