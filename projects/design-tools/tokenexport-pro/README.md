# TokenExport Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers need design tokens (colors, fonts, spacings) from Figma, but extracting them manually or via JSON is cumbersome. Inconsistent handoff of these values can lead to mismatches between design and code.

**Solution:** A Figma plugin that automatically exports all defined styles in a design system to code-friendly formats (CSS variables, JSON, Swift UIColor extension, etc.). It ensures the design’s color styles, text styles, spacing values, and even icons are output in a structured way for developers to plug into their codebas 】. This saves time and avoids human error in transcribing values.

**Target Users:** Design system teams and frontend developers who frequently integrate Figma designs into code. Also solo designers/developers who want a quick way to get design constants without hand coding them.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.3/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-time purchase (e.g. $25 per license) or a team license, since it’s a developer tool used occasionally at milestones. Teams might buy it for multiple designers to ensure consistent token export.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/month; Realistic: $1,000/month; Optimistic: $3,000/month. Many medium-sized product teams maintain design tokens, and a fraction would pay for automation. If ~40 teams buy it monthly, realistic revenue is achievable.

## Development Time
~5 days. Figma’s API provides access to all styles (colors, text styles) and component names. The plugin would format these into chosen outputs (e.g. generating a .js or .json file). With AI assistance, mapping style names to code-friendly naming (e.g. “Primary/Light” to primary-light in CSS) can be sped up.

## Technical Complexity
4/10 – Listing styles and constructing strings for code is straightforward. Slight complexity in formatting (units, naming conventions) and providing UI for user to select output format. No server needed; the plugin can trigger download of files or copy code to clipboard.

## Competition Level
Medium – There are free plugins that export styles to CSS or JSON, and Figma is introducing Tokens features. However, many are basic or require technical tweaking. A polished, multi-format exporter with updates (e.g. handle dark mode tokens or alias tokens) is still valued. Our competitive edge is supporting multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) in one tool and possibly custom templates.

## Key Features
- Multi-format export: Support CSS/SCSS variables, JSON design tokens, JavaScript object, Swift/Android resource files. The user picks their stack and gets a ready-to-use snippet.
- Batch icon export: Option to export all SVG icons from components named a certain way (e.g. all components in an “Icons” frame) into an icon font or SVG sprite directory.
- Name transformation: Automatically convert Figma style names (which might have spaces or slashes) into code-friendly constants (uppercase snake case, camelCase, etc. configurable).
- Style updates sync: Save configurations so that next time, running the plugin only shows changes or can update an existing tokens file with new values (highlighting what changed so devs know to update thos
- 
- 】).
- Documentation stub: Optionally generate a simple markdown or HTML style guide listing tokens and their values (useful for design docs or developer handoff docs).

## Success Indicators
Number of token files exported (signifying use in real projects); positive feedback from dev teams (“Integration of design tokens was seamless”); possibly being recommended in design system communities as the go-to tool. Also, repeat usage by the same teams when design updates occur (indicating it’s part of their workflow) – we might track if possible via version update checks.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** Yes
