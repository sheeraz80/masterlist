# TokenExport Pro - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Design system teams and frontend developers who frequently integrate Figma designs into code. Also solo designers/developers who want a quick way to get design constants without hand coding them.

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase (e.g. $25 per license) or a team license, since it’s a developer tool used occasionally at milestones. Teams might buy it for multiple designers to ensure consistent token export.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/month; Realistic: $1,000/month; Optimistic: $3,000/month. Many medium-sized product teams maintain design tokens, and a fraction would pay for automation. If ~40 teams buy it monthly, realistic revenue is achievable.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Market to design system engineers and tech-savvy designers: it drastically cuts down boilerplate work each time a token changes or a design system is refreshed. Emphasize accuracy (no more typos in hex codes). Price as a one-time toolkit – easier to get approval for a small expense than a subscription in many companies. We can partner with developer advocacy – e.g. publish articles or tips on how to integrate design tokens with our plugin. Possibly upsell with future enhancements (like connecting directly to code repos via API, if possible, in a “Pro” version).

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
