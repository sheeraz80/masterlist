# TokenExport Pro - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10 – Listing styles and constructing strings for code is straightforward. Slight complexity in formatting (units, naming conventions) and providing UI for user to select output format. No server needed; the plugin can trigger download of files or copy code to clipboard.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. Figma’s API provides access to all styles (colors, text styles) and component names. The plugin would format these into chosen outputs (e.g. generating a .js or .json file). With AI assistance, mapping style names to code-friendly naming (e.g. “Primary/Light” to primary-light in CSS) can be sped up.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that automatically exports all defined styles in a design system to code-friendly formats (CSS variables, JSON, Swift UIColor extension, etc.). It ensures the design’s color styles, text styles, spacing values, and even icons are output in a structured way for developers to plug into their codebas 】. This saves time and avoids human error in transcribing values.
