# Theme Studio

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Many users love to customize the look of Obsidian, but creating a theme from scratch requires deep CSS knowledge. There is no easy way for non-developers to create their own personal theme.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a visual, WYSIWYG editor for creating and customizing Obsidian themes. Users can use color pickers and font selectors to change every aspect of the UI and save it as a new theme.

**Target Users:** Aesthetically-minded users, designers, and anyone who wants a personalized note-taking environment.

- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $1,800/mo; Optimistic: $4,500/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin would provide a webview UI with controls for all of Obsidian's CSS variables. It would then generate a file that the user can place in their vault's snippets folder or publish as a full theme.

## Competition Level
Low. The Style Settings plugin allows tweaking existing themes, but a full "Theme Studio" for creating themes from scratch is a new concept.

## Key Features
- Visual Theme Editor: A comprehensive UI with color pickers and font selectors for all major editor elements.
- Live Preview: See your changes applied to the Obsidian UI in real-time as you make them.
- Import Existing Theme: Start by importing the styles from an existing theme you like and then tweak them.
- Export as Theme: Package your creation into a proper theme folder, ready to be used or shared with the community.
- Shareable Palettes: Save and share color palettes with other users.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and a vibrant community of users sharing themes created with the tool.
