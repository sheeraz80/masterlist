# Localization Text Swapper - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Designing for multilingual applications requires managing and previewing text in various languages. Manually copying and pasting translations from spreadsheets into Figma is error-prone and doesn't account for text expansion or contraction, which can break layouts.

### Target Market
Designers working on global products, localization teams, and agencies with international clients.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. This is a specific utility that solves a major pain point in the localization workflow. While Google Sheets Sync exists, it's generic; this tool would be purpose-built for the localization use case.
