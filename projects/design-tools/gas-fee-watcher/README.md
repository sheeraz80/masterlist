# Gas Fee Watcher

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** High and volatile transaction fees (gas) on networks like Ethereum are a major pain point for users. Timing transactions for when gas is cheap can save significant money, but this requires constantly monitoring an external site like Etherscan Gas Tracker.

**Solution:** A simple browser toolbar extension that displays the current gas price for major blockchains in real-time and provides historical charts and notifications for low-gas periods.

**Target Users:** Active DeFi and NFT traders, and anyone who frequently makes transactions on high-fee blockchains.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Free (with affiliate links).

## Revenue Potential
Minimal direct revenue; focus on user adoption and affiliate referrals.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. The extension periodically calls a public gas price API (e.g., from Etherscan or any node provider) and updates the icon in the browser toolbar. All logic is client-side.

## Competition Level
Low. While gas tracker websites are common, a simple, dedicated browser extension for this purpose is a less-served niche that provides high utility.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Gas Price Icon: The extension's toolbar icon always shows the current gas price for a selected network (e.g., Ethereum).
- Multi-Network Support: Easily switch between viewing gas prices for Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.
- Gas Price Notifications: Users can set a threshold (e.g., 15 gwei) and receive a browser notification when the gas price drops below that level.
- Simple Historical Chart: Clicking the icon shows a simple chart of gas prices over the last 24 hours.
- Affiliate Links: The popup can include non-intrusive affiliate links to hardware wallets or crypto exchanges.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users, click-through rate on affiliate links.
