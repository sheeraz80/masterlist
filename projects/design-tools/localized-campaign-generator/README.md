# Localized Campaign Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Expanding into new international markets requires localizing marketing campaigns, which is more than just direct translation. It requires cultural nuance and rewriting copy to be relevant, a task that is expensive and slow with traditional translation agencies.

**Solution:** A Jasper workflow that takes an existing marketing campaign's copy (ads, landing page) and uses AI to not only translate it but also rewrite it for cultural relevance in a chosen target market.

**Target Users:** Global marketing teams, e-commerce businesses, and SaaS companies looking to expand internationally.
