# MicroAnimator (Interactive Exporter)

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Designing micro-interactions (small animations like button hover effects or loading spinners) in Figma is possible via Smart Animate, but exporting those animations for development (as GIFs or Lottie JSON) is not straightforward. Developers often have to recreate animations from scratch. There’s a gap in handing off polished micro-animations from design to implementation.

**Solution:** A Figma plugin that lets designers create simple timeline animations (or uses prototype Smart Animations) and export them as real animated assets: GIF, MP4, or Lottie (for use in apps or websites). It could provide a timeline interface or simply convert frame-by-frame variations into an animation file. This eliminates the need to redo work in Adobe After Effects or code.

**Target Users:** UI/UX designers in product teams who design animated transitions, loading indicators, icon animations, etc., and want to easily share those with developers. Also web designers creating banner ads or social media graphics in Figma who need GIF/MP4 output.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-time purchase for a plugin license, likely higher price due to the niche but high value (e.g. $30 per user) – comparable to how some designers paid for “Bannerify” or “Pitchdeck” plugins. Alternatively, a freemium model where basic GIF export is free but Lottie export and advanced controls are in a Pro version.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/month; Realistic: $2,000/month; Optimistic: $6,000/month. This is based on capturing a portion of designers who frequently work with animations – likely a smaller segment, but they may be willing to pay more. Hypermatic’s similar plugin (Bannerify for HTML/GIF banners) shows demand exists for animation exports from Figma.

## Development Time
~7 days. Figma’s API can access node properties, but not a timeline of prototype animations. We might need the designer to explicitly create keyframes (e.g. duplicate a frame for each step). Exporting GIF/MP4 can be done by capturing frames (rasterizing each frame via the plugin and assembling – might require a canvas library). Lottie (JSON) export is harder; possibly integrate with an open-source library or restrict to simple vector shapes animations. AI assistance may help with image processing code but this is largely technical.

## Technical Complexity
7/10 – Capturing Figma designs into an animation is tricky. If using a frame sequence approach: user labels frames as steps, we capture each as an image and compile to GIF/MP4 (we’d likely use an offscreen canvas or ask user to download frames and use FFmpeg externally – but since zero-server, maybe pure JS GIF encoder). Lottie export requires mapping Figma shapes to Lottie format – very complex to do fully; perhaps focus on basic shape animations. We might initially limit to GIF/MP4 which are easier (though large frames might cause performance issues). Ensuring decent quality and performance is a challenge.

## Competition Level
Medium – There are existing paid plugins like “Bannerify” (exports animated banners to GIF/HTML) and “Figmotion” (an animation timeline plugin) which is free and open-source. Figmotion allows creating timeline animations in Figma and exporting JSON or GIF. However, Figmotion has a learning curve and might not have Lottie support. Our angle: make it more user-friendly or focused on micro-interactions, and possibly leverage Figma’s native Smart Animate for simplicity (like automatically tween between two frames). Competition exists but there’s room if we simplify and polish the experience for a price.

## Key Features
- Frame sequence to GIF: Take a series of frames (or variants) and export as an animated GIF or MP4 video. Options for frame duration and looping.
- Smart Animate capture: If user has set up a prototype between two frames with Smart Animate, the plugin can tween between them and record that animation (this might involve rapidly changing properties via API and capturing – experimental but powerful).
- Lottie JSON (Pro): Export simple vector animations to Lottie (e.g. shape position, scale, opacity changes) for use in apps. Possibly limited to animations created in a special way (like via an integrated timeline UI in the plugin for supported properties).
- Controls: Basic timeline UI to adjust easing, delays between frames, and preview the animation inside Figma before export.
- Templates: A small library of pre-made micro-interactions (like a bouncing loader, a fade-in effect) that users can apply to their layers as a starting point.

## Success Indicators
Number of exports performed (if people are regularly using it, it’s valuable); revenue from licenses, especially any team purchases (if companies buy for multiple designers, that’s a strong sign); feedback like “dev team could implement exactly what I designed using this export” indicating we solved a real handoff problem; and possibly decreased turnaround time for adding animations to products as reported by users.
