# MicroAnimator (Interactive Exporter) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10 – Capturing Figma designs into an animation is tricky. If using a frame sequence approach: user labels frames as steps, we capture each as an image and compile to GIF/MP4 (we’d likely use an offscreen canvas or ask user to download frames and use FFmpeg externally – but since zero-server, maybe pure JS GIF encoder). Lottie export requires mapping Figma shapes to Lottie format – very complex to do fully; perhaps focus on basic shape animations. We might initially limit to GIF/MP4 which are easier (though large frames might cause performance issues). Ensuring decent quality and performance is a challenge.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Figma’s API can access node properties, but not a timeline of prototype animations. We might need the designer to explicitly create keyframes (e.g. duplicate a frame for each step). Exporting GIF/MP4 can be done by capturing frames (rasterizing each frame via the plugin and assembling – might require a canvas library). Lottie (JSON) export is harder; possibly integrate with an open-source library or restrict to simple vector shapes animations. AI assistance may help with image processing code but this is largely technical.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that lets designers create simple timeline animations (or uses prototype Smart Animations) and export them as real animated assets: GIF, MP4, or Lottie (for use in apps or websites). It could provide a timeline interface or simply convert frame-by-frame variations into an animation file. This eliminates the need to redo work in Adobe After Effects or code.

## Technical Requirements
