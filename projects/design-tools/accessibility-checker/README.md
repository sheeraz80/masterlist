# Accessibility Checker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Web developers and designers need to ensure their sites are accessible, but running full audits can be complex. They need a quick way to check for common accessibility issues on the fly.

**Solution:** A simple, developer-focused extension that scans the current page and highlights common WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) violations, such as missing alt text, low-contrast text, missing form labels, and improper heading structure.

**Target Users:** Front-end developers, UI/UX designers, and QA testers.

## Quality Score
