### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A subscription model for a tool that provides ongoing value and stores user data. Tiers: Free: Up to 100 highlights and notes, local storage only. Pro ($5/month): Unlimited highlights, cloud sync, and advanced export options. Acquisition: Target student and research communities. Partner with educational influencers. Offer a free version that is generous enough to become part of a user's workflow.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: Reliably anchoring highlights to text on dynamic web pages is a notoriously difficult problem. The system must be robust against changes in the page's DOM. Data Portability: Users will want to own their data. Providing excellent export functionality is crucial for building trust.
