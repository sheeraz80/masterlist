# Web Page Annotator & Highlighter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Researchers and students read extensively online but lack a good way to highlight text and add notes directly to web pages, similar to how they would with a physical book or a PDF. Bookmarking is not enough to retain context.

**Solution:** A browser extension that allows users to highlight text on any webpage with multiple colors and add sticky notes. All annotations are saved and automatically reappear when the user revisits the page.

**Target Users:** Students, researchers, journalists, and avid online readers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $7,000/mo; Optimistic: $25,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. Uses content scripts to inject the highlighting and note-taking UI into the page. Selections and note content are stored using .local, keyed by the page URL. The main challenge is reliably re-applying highlights to the correct text when the page is revisited, especially if the page content is dynamic.

## Competition Level
Medium. Tools like Liner and Hypothesis exist. The opportunity is to offer a simpler, more intuitive UI, better export options (e.g., direct to Notion/Obsidian), and a more affordable pricing model.

## Key Features
- Multi-Color Highlighting: Highlight text on any webpage with a palette of colors.
- Sticky Notes: Add notes to any part of a page.
- Centralized Dashboard: A central UI to view and search all highlights and notes from across the web.
- Export to Markdown (Pro): Export all annotations from a page to a clean Markdown file, perfect for knowledge management apps.
- Cloud Sync & Sharing (Pro): Sync annotations across devices and share annotated pages with others.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and the total number of annotations made by users.
