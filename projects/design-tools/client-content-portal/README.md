# Client Content Portal

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Design agencies struggle with the content collection phase of a project. Giving clients direct edit access to Figma is risky, as they can accidentally move or break design elements. Using email or Google Docs is disconnected from the design itself, leading to confusion and manual data entry.

**Solution:** A plugin that generates a simple, secure, and shareable web page from a Figma file. On this page, clients can view the designs and edit only the text and image layers that the designer has specifically marked as "editable," with changes syncing back to Figma.

**Target Users:** Design agencies, freelance designers, and teams that collaborate with non-designer stakeholders.

## Quality Score

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,500/mo; Realistic: $12,000/mo; Optimistic: $50,000/mo.

## Development Time
7+ days (this is at the upper end of the quick development constraint).

## Technical Complexity
This is a mini-SaaS product, not just a simple plugin. It requires web development skills beyond the typical plugin. The 7-day timeline is ambitious. Security: The web portal must be secure to protect client and design data.

## Competition Level
Very Low. This is a novel solution to a very high-value problem. It creates a new category of "collaboration portal" for Figma, going beyond simple commenting.

## Key Features
- Editable Layer Tagging: A simple way for designers to mark text and image layers as editable by clients.
- Portal Generation: A one-click button to generate the unique, password-protected web portal.
- Client-Friendly UI: A super-simple web interface for clients with no design tools, just content fields.
- Two-Way Sync: Changes made by the client can be pulled back into Figma by the designer.
- Activity Log: A simple history of content changes made by the client.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active agencies, and testimonials from agency owners about improved efficiency and client satisfaction.
