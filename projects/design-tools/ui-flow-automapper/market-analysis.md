# UI Flow AutoMapper - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Creating user flow diagrams can be time-consuming – designers often manually draw flowcharts to show how screens connect (e.g. login -> dashboard -> settings). While Figma has prototyping links, there’s no easy way to visualize those as a high-level flow diagram for presentations or documentation.

### Target Market
UX designers, product managers, and anyone who needs to communicate screen flows or app structure. Especially useful after wireframing or during design reviews to quickly get a bird’s-eye view of navigation.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low – No known direct plugin that “auto-draws” flow diagrams from prototypes. Some tools outside Figma (like Overflow or UXPressia) do user flows, but require extra work. If any plugin exists, it’s not prominent, so entering now could capture the niche.

### Competitive Landscape
Low – No known direct plugin that “auto-draws” flow diagrams from prototypes. Some tools outside Figma (like Overflow or UXPressia) do user flows, but require extra work. If any plugin exists, it’s not prominent, so entering now could capture the niche.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase (e.g. $10 per user) via Figma Community or external. This tool is a bit situational (used when documenting flows), so a recurring fee might be less appealing; a low one-time price can drive volume. Possibly a free tier that generates flows for up to 10 screens, and a paid for unlimited (for those doing big apps).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $250/month; Realistic: $1,000/month; Optimistic: $3,000/month. Many designers would find this handy occasionally – conversion depends on how often they document flows. Optimistically, if it becomes popular on Figma Community and say 100 people buy weekly, that’s achievable.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 250/month
- **Realistic:** 1,000/month
- **Optimistic:** 3,000/month

### Monetization Strategy
Market it as a huge time-saver for UX documentation – “Turn your prototype into a flowchart in seconds.” The audience will likely find this on Figma Community or through word of mouth. We could create short videos for LinkedIn/Twitter showcasing complex app maps created instantly. Given the low price, volume is key: aim to make it a must-have in designers’ toolkit by being the first well-known plugin for this. Use any positive reviews to boost credibility. Also consider contacting design bloggers to include it in “top plugins” lists once it gains traction.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
User value risk: If the auto-layout of the flow is messy for large projects, users might not find it useful. Mitigation: allow manual adjustments post-generation (since it’s just Figma shapes, they can move them) and focus on moderate-size flows initially. Gather feedback to improve layout algorithms. Platform: The Figma API for prototype might be limited (if certain complex flows can’t be read easily, we document limitations). Competition: If Figma were to introduce a “flow view” natively (no indication yet, but possible given design handoff needs), it would obsolete this plugin. Mitigate by being available now and perhaps expanding to features Figma might not do (like cross-file flows or additional annotations).

### Key Risks
- Platform dependency risk
- Competition risk
- Technical implementation risk
- Market adoption risk
- Revenue sustainability risk

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify across multiple platforms
- Focus on unique value proposition
- Maintain technical excellence
- Build strong user community
- Develop sustainable revenue streams

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

## Success Indicators
How many flowcharts generated (especially for paid users); reduction in time spent on manual flow diagrams as reported by users; sales numbers and plugin user count; and qualitative feedback – e.g. if product managers start requesting designers to use it (an indicator of demand from stakeholders). Also, inclusion in design workflow recommendations would be a sign of success.
