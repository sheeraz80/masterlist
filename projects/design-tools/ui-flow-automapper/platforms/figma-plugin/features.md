# UI Flow AutoMapper - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Auto-generate flowchart: With one click, produce a flow diagram of all frames and their prototype links. Frames become nodes in the diagram with arrows connecting them per interactions (e.g. buttons linking to other screens).
- Layout options: Choose layout style – e.g. vertical tree, horizontal, or force-directed. (Offer a few for user to pick what looks best.)
- Annotations: Label the connectors with the interaction (if a Figma interaction has a condition or label, include that text on the arrow, e.g. “on success” or “click Login”).
- Selective generation: Option to generate flow for a selection or a page, not the whole file, if user wants to focus on a subset.
- Update sync: After generation, if the design changes or prototype links update, running the plugin again can update the flowchart (or generate a new one). Possibly highlight changes if re-run (like new screen added).
