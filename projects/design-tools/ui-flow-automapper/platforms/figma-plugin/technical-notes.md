# UI Flow AutoMapper - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10 â€“ Parsing the graph of screens and connections is straightforward; the challenge is nicely laying it out without overlaps. We might use a basic heuristic (e.g. column by app section). Ensuring it looks clean for very complex flows might be tough, but we can start simple. No server needed; all computation and creation done within Figma environment.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. Accessing prototype links via Figma API is possible (the API provides interaction info). Generating a diagram can be done by creating new nodes (shapes and connectors) in Figma or outputting to a FigJam file (which might require writing a .json). The logic to layout the flow could use a simple algorithm (or delegate to a small JS graph layout library). AI not needed except maybe to assist in auto-layout of the graph, but deterministic algorithms suffice.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that reads the prototype connections between frames in a Figma file and automatically generates a flowchart (could be in a new FigJam board or as grouped arrows and labels in Figma). It essentially turns your interactive prototype links into a sitemap/flow diagram, saving hours of drawing boxes and arrows.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
