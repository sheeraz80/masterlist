# DeFi Lego Builder

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Composing complex DeFi transactions that interact with multiple protocols (e.g., borrow from Aave, swap on Uniswap, deposit into Yearn) is only possible for highly technical users and requires writing custom smart contracts.

**Solution:** A visual, drag-and-drop interface for building complex, multi-step DeFi transactions. The tool then bundles these actions into a single transaction using a smart contract wallet or a transaction bundler.

**Target Users:** Advanced DeFi power users and "degens."

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Commission on transactions.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $10,000/mo; Optimistic: $50,000+/mo.

## Development Time
7+ days (very ambitious).

## Technical Complexity
This is a major engineering challenge, likely beyond the 3-7 day scope.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a highly advanced tool. Some platforms like Furucombo offer this, but an open, browser-based tool would be powerful.

## Key Features
- Visual Flow Builder: A canvas where users can drag and drop "blocks" representing actions on different protocols (e.g., "Swap," "Lend," "Borrow").
- Protocol Library: A library of pre-built blocks for interacting with major DeFi protocols.
- Transaction Simulation: Simulates the entire multi-step transaction to show the expected outcome before signing.
- Shared Recipes: Users can save and share their complex transaction "recipes" with the community.

## Success Indicators
Total transaction volume processed, number of active users, and a clean audit history.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
