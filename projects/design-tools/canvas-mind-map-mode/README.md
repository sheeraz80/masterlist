# Canvas Mind Map Mode

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Obsidian's Canvas is great for freeform brainstorming, but it lacks the structured features of a dedicated mind-mapping tool, such as automatic layouts and easy keyboard navigation to create new nodes.

**Solution:** A plugin that adds a "Mind Map Mode" to Canvas. This mode provides keyboard shortcuts and automatic layout algorithms to make creating structured mind maps fast and intuitive.

**Target Users:** Students, writers, and anyone who uses mind maps for planning and brainstorming.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity


## Competition Level
Medium. The Mind Map plugin exists, but it's a separate view. This enhances the core Canvas plugin, which is a more integrated approach.

## Key Features
- Keyboard-First Creation: Use keys like Tab to create a new child node and Enter to create a sibling node, just like in a traditional outliner.
- Automatic Layouts: A button to automatically arrange all canvas cards into a clean, hierarchical mind map layout.
- Quick Styling: Easily apply colors and styles to different branches of the mind map.
- Convert to Outline: A one-click command to convert a mind map into a nested Markdown list in a new note.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and becoming the standard way to create mind maps in Obsidian.
