# Data Visualization Wizard - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Standard chart plugins in Figma are great for basic bar, line, and pie charts, but they lack support for more complex and specialized data visualizations like Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, or chord diagrams, which are essential for data-heavy dashboards and reports.

### Target Market
Data analysts, UX designers working on analytics products, and researchers who need to present complex data visually.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. This is a clear gap in the market. Existing chart plugins focus on the most common chart types, leaving advanced visualizations underserved.

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A core one-time purchase for the main plugin, with additional advanced chart types sold as separate "add-on packs." Pricing: Core Plugin ($39): Includes Sankey, Heatmap, and Treemap. Advanced Pack 1 ($19): Adds Chord and Sunburst diagrams. Acquisition: Target data visualization communities (e.g., /r/dataisbeautiful). Write tutorials on creating specific chart types. Showcase beautiful examples on a dedicated gallery website.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: Integrating and controlling a complex library like within a Figma plugin can be challenging. Ensuring the SVG output is clean and performant is critical. Market Risk: The audience for these specific chart types is smaller than for basic charts, but they have a more acute need and higher willingness to pay.
