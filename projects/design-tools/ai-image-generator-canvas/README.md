# AI Image Generator (Canvas)

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** When brainstorming or mind-mapping on the Obsidian Canvas, users often want to include images to represent ideas, but finding or creating them requires leaving the app, which disrupts the creative flow.

**Solution:** A plugin that adds a new type of card to the Canvas: an "AI Image Card." The user types a text prompt into the card, and it's replaced by an AI-generated image.

**Target Users:** Visual thinkers, designers, writers, and anyone using Canvas for brainstorming and mood boarding.

## Quality Score

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $7,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin would integrate with an AI image generation API like DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion. The user provides their own API key. The plugin's logic handles the API call and replaces the canvas card's content with the generated image.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a novel feature that directly enhances a core Obsidian plugin in a unique way.

## Key Features
- Direct Canvas Integration: Generate images directly within the Canvas view.
- Prompt-Based Generation: Simply type a description to create an image.
- Style Presets: Choose from different artistic styles (e.g., photorealistic, sketch, abstract).
- Image-to-Image: Drag an existing image onto an AI card and provide a prompt to create a variation.
- Local Saving: Generated images are automatically saved to the vault's attachments folder.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales and a gallery of creative Canvases shared by the community.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
