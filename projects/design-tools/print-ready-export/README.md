# Print-Ready Export

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Figma is primarily a digital design tool, but designers sometimes need to prepare assets for print (e.g., business cards, posters). Figma lacks native tools for print production, such as CMYK color conversion or adding printer's marks and bleed.

**Solution:** A utility that prepares a selected Figma frame for professional printing by converting colors to a CMYK profile, adding configurable bleed and crop marks, and packaging the output as a print-ready PDF.

**Target Users:** Graphic designers, brand designers, and marketing teams who work in Figma but occasionally need to produce printed materials.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.3/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/mo; Realistic: $1,500/mo; Optimistic: $4,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Color space conversion (RGB to CMYK) is the most complex part and would likely require a robust client-side JavaScript library. Generating the PDF with proper marks and bleed would also require a PDF generation library. The plugin would essentially be a specialized file converter.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a niche workflow that bridges the gap between Figma and traditional print design tools like Adobe Illustrator. A user on Reddit created a basic version, indicating a clear need.

## Key Features
- CMYK Conversion: Converts all colors in the selected frame from RGB to a specified CMYK profile.
- Bleed and Crop Marks: Allows the user to specify a bleed amount and automatically adds crop marks to the final output.
- PDF Export: Exports the final design as a high-resolution, print-ready PDF.
- Font Outlining: An option to convert all text to vector outlines to avoid font issues at the printer.
- Preset Profiles: Pre-configured settings for common print jobs (e.g., "U. S. Business Card", "A4 Flyer").

## Success Indicators
Total sales, and partnerships with printing services.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
