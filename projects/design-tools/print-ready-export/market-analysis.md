# Print-Ready Export - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Figma is primarily a digital design tool, but designers sometimes need to prepare assets for print (e.g., business cards, posters). Figma lacks native tools for print production, such as CMYK color conversion or adding printer's marks and bleed.

### Target Market
Graphic designers, brand designers, and marketing teams who work in Figma but occasionally need to produce printed materials.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A one-time purchase for a specialized, professional utility. Pricing: $39 one-time purchase. Designers accustomed to expensive Adobe software would see this as a bargain. Acquisition: Target designers in forums who are asking how to use Figma for print work. Partner with online printing companies to promote the plugin to their customers.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: Accurate color management is extremely difficult. The CMYK conversion must be reliable, or it could lead to costly printing errors for users. This is a high-stakes utility. Market Risk: Most heavy-duty print work is still done in Adobe Illustrator. The market is for Figma-first designers who only occasionally need to print.
