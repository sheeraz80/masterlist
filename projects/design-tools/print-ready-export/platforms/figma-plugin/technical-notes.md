# Print-Ready Export - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. Color space conversion (RGB to CMYK) is the most complex part and would likely require a robust client-side JavaScript library. Generating the PDF with proper marks and bleed would also require a PDF generation library. The plugin would essentially be a specialized file converter.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 5-6 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A utility that prepares a selected Figma frame for professional printing by converting colors to a CMYK profile, adding configurable bleed and crop marks, and packaging the output as a print-ready PDF.
