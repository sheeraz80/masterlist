# Theme Customizer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers love customizing their editor's appearance, but creating a full VSCode theme from scratch is a complex process. Most users just want to tweak the colors of an existing theme they like.

**Solution:** An extension that provides a UI for customizing the colors of the currently active theme. Users can use color pickers to change common editor colors (background, text, comments, strings, etc.) and save the result as a new, personalized theme.

**Target Users:** All VSCode users who are particular about their editor's appearance.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.5/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $1,800/mo; Optimistic: $4,500/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension would need to read the color definitions from the current theme's JSON file, display them in a webview UI with color pickers, and then generate a new theme JSON file with the user's customizations.

## Competition Level
Low. While there are thousands of themes, there are very few tools that make it easy for non-developers to create or customize themes.

## Key Features
- Live Theme Editor: A sidebar panel with color pickers for common editor elements. Changes are applied to the editor in real-time.
- Import Existing Theme: Start by importing the colors from your currently active theme.
- Save as New Theme: Save your customizations as a new, private theme that appears in your theme list.
- Share Theme: Export the generated theme files so you can share them with others.
- Simple Color Tweaks: Focus on the most common colors, not every single possible token, to keep the UI simple.

## Success Indicators
Total sales and a community of users sharing the themes they've created with the tool.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
