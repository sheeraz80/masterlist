# Docker Compose Companion

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While the official Docker extension for VSCode is powerful, managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose often still requires dropping into the terminal to run commands like docker-compose up -d or docker-compose logs -f service_name.

**Solution:** A dedicated UI panel that visualizes the services in a file, allowing users to start, stop, and restart individual services and view their logs with a single click.

**Target Users:** Web developers and DevOps engineers using Docker for local development.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.0/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $3,500/mo; Optimistic: $10,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension would parse the file and then execute the corresponding docker-compose commands in the integrated terminal. The UI would be a webview panel.

## Competition Level
High. The official Docker extension is the main competitor. The opportunity is to create a more intuitive and user-friendly UI specifically for the Docker Compose workflow, which can sometimes be clunky in the official extension.

## Key Features
- Service Dashboard: A list of all services defined in the compose file, with status indicators (running, stopped).
- One-Click Controls: Buttons to start, stop, restart, and rebuild individual services or the entire stack.
- Integrated Log Viewer: A panel to view the real-time logs for any service without manually running the command.
- Quick Terminal Access: A button to quickly open a shell inside a running container for debugging.
- Resource Usage (Pro): A premium feature to show real-time CPU and memory usage for each running container.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and reviews praising its streamlined workflow for Docker Compose.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
