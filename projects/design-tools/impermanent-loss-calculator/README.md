# Impermanent Loss Calculator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Providing liquidity to a DeFi automated market maker (AMM) comes with the risk of impermanent loss (IL), a concept that is notoriously difficult for new users to understand and calculate. This prevents many from participating in liquidity pools.

**Solution:** A simple, educational browser extension that activates on AMM pages like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. It adds a calculator that clearly visualizes the potential impermanent loss of a liquidity position based on hypothetical price changes.

**Target Users:** New and intermediate DeFi users, and anyone looking to provide liquidity to an AMM.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Free (Donation-based).

## Revenue Potential
N/A. Focus on building a reputation as an educator in the space.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. The logic is a well-known mathematical formula that can be implemented in client-side JavaScript. The main work is injecting the UI into the target dApp pages.

## Competition Level
Low. While some websites offer IL calculators, an integrated tool that works directly on the AMM's interface would be a much better user experience.

## Key Features
- Integrated Calculator: A simple UI that appears on liquidity pool pages.
- Visual Sliders: Users can drag sliders to see how changes in token prices affect the value of their position and their IL.
- Clear Explanations: Provides a simple, plain-English explanation of what impermanent loss is and how it works.
- "Vs. HODL" Comparison: Shows the value of the LP position compared to simply holding the original tokens.

## Success Indicators
Number of downloads, positive reviews, and mentions by DeFi educators.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
