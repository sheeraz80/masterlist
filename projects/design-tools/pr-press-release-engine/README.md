# PR & Press Release Engine

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Startups and small businesses need to send out press releases for launches or funding announcements but often can't afford a PR agency. Writing a professional press release that follows the standard format is a specialized skill they lack.

**Solution:** A guided Jasper workflow that takes a user through a step-by-step process to create a professional press release. The user inputs the key details (who, what, when, where, why), and the tool uses Jasper to generate a perfectly formatted press release.

**Target Users:** Startup founders, small business owners, and in-house marketing teams.
