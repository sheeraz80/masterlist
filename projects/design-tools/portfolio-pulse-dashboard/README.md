# Portfolio Pulse Dashboard

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Crypto investors often hold assets across multiple wallets and blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Base). Tracking their total portfolio value requires using multiple block explorers or a centralized portfolio tracker that may have privacy concerns.

**Solution:** A privacy-first, client-side portfolio tracker that aggregates data from public blockchain APIs. Users input their public wallet addresses, and the extension provides a unified dashboard of their holdings without requiring private keys or server-side data storage.

**Target Users:** Crypto investors, DeFi users, and NFT collectors with assets on multiple chains.

## Quality Score

- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 4/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $9,000/mo; Optimistic: $30,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The core of the extension involves making API calls to multiple blockchain data providers (e.g., Covalent, NOWNodes, Etherscan) and price data APIs (e.g., CoinGecko). All data is fetched and processed on the client-side and stored in local browser storage.

## Competition Level
High. DeBank and Zerion are popular free tools. The unique value proposition is a focus on privacy (no server-side tracking), a cleaner UI, and potentially better NFT and obscure DeFi protocol support.

## Key Features
- Multi-Chain Aggregation: Connects multiple public addresses from Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base, and other EVM chains.
- Unified Dashboard: A single view showing total portfolio value, token breakdown, and NFT galleries.
- Profit & Loss Tracking: Simple P&L analysis based on transaction history pulled from explorer APIs.
- DeFi Position Tracking: Shows positions in major liquidity pools, staking protocols, and lending platforms.
- Privacy-First: No user accounts or server-side databases. All data is stored and processed locally.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and user growth.
