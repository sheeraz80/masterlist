# Redline & Spec Exporter - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. This is a complex geometry and data extraction task. The plugin needs to measure distances between elements, read all their properties (fills, strokes, fonts, etc.), identify which assets should be exportable, and then programmatically generate a new, well-organized Figma frame containing all this information.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that automatically generates a detailed design specification page from a selected frame. This page would include redline annotations for spacing, asset export previews, and tables of all colors and fonts used.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
