# Redline & Spec Exporter - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
The developer handoff process requires designers to manually create "redline" specifications, detailing measurements, colors, fonts, and asset information. While Figma's Dev Mode helps, creating a comprehensive, shareable spec sheet for stakeholders or documentation is still a manual process.

### Target Market
UI/UX designers, product teams, and front-end developers.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Figma's own Dev Mode is the main competitor. The opportunity is to create a more customizable and better-formatted output that can be shared as a standalone document or page within the Figma file, targeting communication with non-developer stakeholders as well.

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A one-time purchase for a powerful professional utility. Pricing: $49 one-time purchase. This price is justifiable given the significant time savings for a critical workflow. Acquisition: Market in developer and designer communities focused on improving the handoff process. Create content comparing the plugin's output to manual specification or Figma's default Dev Mode.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Competition: Figma's continuous improvement of Dev Mode is the primary risk. The plugin must offer a superior or different value proposition, such as better formatting or stakeholder-friendly output. Technical Risk: Accurately calculating and drawing all the annotations for a complex layout can be very challenging.
