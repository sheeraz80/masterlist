# Redline & Spec Exporter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The developer handoff process requires designers to manually create "redline" specifications, detailing measurements, colors, fonts, and asset information. While Figma's Dev Mode helps, creating a comprehensive, shareable spec sheet for stakeholders or documentation is still a manual process.

**Solution:** A plugin that automatically generates a detailed design specification page from a selected frame. This page would include redline annotations for spacing, asset export previews, and tables of all colors and fonts used.

**Target Users:** UI/UX designers, product teams, and front-end developers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.4/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $7,500/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is a complex geometry and data extraction task. The plugin needs to measure distances between elements, read all their properties (fills, strokes, fonts, etc.), identify which assets should be exportable, and then programmatically generate a new, well-organized Figma frame containing all this information.

## Competition Level
Medium. Figma's own Dev Mode is the main competitor. The opportunity is to create a more customizable and better-formatted output that can be shared as a standalone document or page within the Figma file, targeting communication with non-developer stakeholders as well.

## Key Features
- Automated Annotation: Automatically draws redlines and labels for spacing, padding, and element dimensions.
- Property Tables: Generates tables listing all colors, text styles, and variables used in the selection.
- Asset Sheet: Creates a sheet showing all icons and images marked for export, along with their export settings.
- Customizable Templates: Users can customize the layout and appearance of the generated specification sheet.
- Interactive Elements: The generated spec sheet can contain links that, when clicked, select the corresponding layer in the original design.

## Success Indicators
Total sales, and testimonials from teams about smoother developer handoffs.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
