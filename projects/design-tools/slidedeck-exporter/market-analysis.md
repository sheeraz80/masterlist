# SlideDeck Exporter - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Turning Figma designs into presentation decks (for client readouts, pitch decks, etc.) is manual. Designers often take screenshots of Figma frames and paste into PowerPoint or Google Slides, then animate or adjust. This duplication of effort is time-consuming.

### Target Market
UX/UI designers presenting designs to stakeholders, product managers compiling presentations of design work, and startup founders who design pitch slides in Figma (increasingly common). Also agencies packaging deliverables as PowerPoint.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium – Hypermatic’s Pitchdeck is a direct competitor (they charge subscription or bundl】). Ours could differentiate by pricing model or simplicity. Also, Google Slides now has Figma integration (but that’s more embedding Figma prototype into a slide, not native export). There’s also Figmagic for Notion exports, etc. But specifically for PPT, competition is limited. If we match core needs and price lower than existing, we can capture budget-conscious users.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase, likely on the higher side (e.g. $40) because it replaces a lot of tedious work each project. Many might expense it for a client project. Alternatively, a lower subscription if we anticipate frequent usage, but one-time fits since each user might use it per project cycle.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/month; Realistic: $2,000/month; Optimistic: $6,000/month. Given that an existing plugin (Pitchdeck by Hypermatic) does this and likely has significant users, the demand is prove】. By capturing a slice of that market or appealing to those who need a simpler/cheaper alternative, we could see solid sales. Optimistic if we become a top recommended tool for agencies and startups prepping decks.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 500/month
- **Realistic:** 2,000/month
- **Optimistic:** 6,000/month

### Monetization Strategy
Emphasize hours saved: an agency designer might spend half a day making a client presentation from designs – this plugin does it in seconds, so $40 is nothing in comparison. For startups, speed is essential – iterate design and immediately get an updated pitch deck. Our cheaper one-time cost could undercut competitors requiring subscriptio】. Marketing through design blogs, entrepreneur forums, and perhaps bundle with advice like “How to pitch faster with Figma”. We should highlight that one can maintain a single source of truth (the Figma design) and always export the latest deck whenever needed, ensuring consistency.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Quality: If the output PPT is clunky (e.g. just images), some might still prefer manual to have editable slides. We mitigate by gradually improving text support. Also ensure image quality is high to avoid blurriness on projectors (use 2x resolution if needed for retina). File size: Many high-res images could make PPT large; we can compress images slightly (maybe optionally use TinyPNG API if permissible). Competition: We face a known competitor; we must either be better or cheaper (or both). Possibly focus on simplicity (some users might find Pitchdeck complex with animations etc., and just want plain slides cheap). Platform: Relying on undocumented or community PPT generation – ensure we test thoroughly on different Office versions. But as PPTX is standard zip, it’s stable. User adoption: Might take demonstrating to convince “it’s really that easy now” since many accept the slog as given. Provide demo videos to build trust.

### Key Risks
- Platform dependency risk
- Competition risk
- Technical implementation risk
- Market adoption risk
- Revenue sustainability risk

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify across multiple platforms
- Focus on unique value proposition
- Maintain technical excellence
- Build strong user community
- Develop sustainable revenue streams

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Platform user base size
- Market segment size
- Growth potential

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- Targetable user subset
- Geographic limitations
- Platform-specific constraints

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- Realistic market capture
- Competitive positioning
- Resource limitations

## Success Indicators
Sales volume (if we can capture even 50% of those who consider the leading competitor, that’s big). Also, user stories: “We delivered 10 client presentations with no time wasted thanks to SlideDeck Exporter.” If our plugin gets mentioned on social media by satisfied consultants or founders, it will drive further interest. Minimizing support tickets around conversion fidelity is another internal success measure (means our output is robust).
