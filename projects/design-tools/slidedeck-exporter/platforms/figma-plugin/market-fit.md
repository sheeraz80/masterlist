# SlideDeck Exporter - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
UX/UI designers presenting designs to stakeholders, product managers compiling presentations of design work, and startup founders who design pitch slides in Figma (increasingly common). Also agencies packaging deliverables as PowerPoint.

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase, likely on the higher side (e.g. $40) because it replaces a lot of tedious work each project. Many might expense it for a client project. Alternatively, a lower subscription if we anticipate frequent usage, but one-time fits since each user might use it per project cycle.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/month; Realistic: $2,000/month; Optimistic: $6,000/month. Given that an existing plugin (Pitchdeck by Hypermatic) does this and likely has significant users, the demand is prove】. By capturing a slice of that market or appealing to those who need a simpler/cheaper alternative, we could see solid sales. Optimistic if we become a top recommended tool for agencies and startups prepping decks.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Emphasize hours saved: an agency designer might spend half a day making a client presentation from designs – this plugin does it in seconds, so $40 is nothing in comparison. For startups, speed is essential – iterate design and immediately get an updated pitch deck. Our cheaper one-time cost could undercut competitors requiring subscriptio】. Marketing through design blogs, entrepreneur forums, and perhaps bundle with advice like “How to pitch faster with Figma”. We should highlight that one can maintain a single source of truth (the Figma design) and always export the latest deck whenever needed, ensuring consistency.
