# SlideDeck Exporter - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10 – Creating a PPTX (which is essentially a ZIP of XML and media) isn’t trivial but there are libraries. Ensuring formatting consistency is moderate complexity. If we skip editable text, it’s simpler (just export images and wrap them in slides XML). If including text, mapping Figma fonts to system fonts and layout might be messy. We may start with image-based slides (which already solves 90% use case: quick deck visuals), and iterate on adding editable text support for Pro version.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Exporting to PDF is easy (Figma can already export frames to PDF sequence). The challenge is PPTX: we’d need to construct an Office XML format. Possibly use an open-source PPTX library in JS to build slides with images of frames. To keep text editable, we’d have to parse Figma text layers and convert to PPTX text boxes – doable for simple text (font, size, color), though exact fidelity might suffer if Figma uses custom fonts (we can embed or require them). As a simpler route, we export all frames to images and put each as full-slide image in PPT – which is what many do manually. That loses editability but is safe. Perhaps offer choice: quick image slides vs. experimental editable export. AI assistance not needed, straightforward file assembly.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that exports selected frames or pages into a ready-to-use presentation format. It can generate a PowerPoint file (PPTX) or PDF where each Figma frame becomes a slid】. It could also retain text as editable and images separately for later tweaks. Additionally, support simple slide animations or speaker notes derived from Figma prototype links or frame descriptions. Essentially an automated way to go from design to deck.

## Technical Requirements
