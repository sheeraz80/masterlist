# AI-Powered YouTube Summarizer & Mind Map

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Watching long YouTube videos (lectures, tutorials, podcasts) for key information is time-consuming. Users need a way to quickly grasp the main points and structure of a video without watching it in its entirety.

**Solution:** An extension that uses an AI API to generate a concise summary, a timeline with clickable timestamps for key topics, and a visual mind map of the video's content.

**Target Users:** Students, lifelong learners, researchers, and professionals who use YouTube for educational content.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium (Credit-based).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $8,000/mo; Optimistic: $35,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires fetching the video transcript using a third-party library or service. This transcript is then sent to an AI text generation API (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) with a specific prompt to generate the summary and structured data for the timeline/mind map. The mind map can be rendered client-side using a JavaScript library. The user provides their own API key.

## Competition Level
Medium. Extensions like YouTube Summary with ChatGPT & Claude exist. The unique value proposition is the addition of a visual mind map and a more integrated, polished UI that presents the summary, timeline, and mind map together.

## Key Features
- AI-Generated Summary: Provides a bulleted or paragraph summary of the video's content.
- Clickable Timeline: A timeline of key topics discussed in the video, with timestamps that jump to that part of the video.
- Visual Mind Map: An interactive mind map that visually organizes the video's main ideas and sub-points.
- Export Options: Export summary and mind map to text, markdown, or PNG.
- Language Support: Summarize videos in multiple languages.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit pack sales, number of summaries generated, and user reviews highlighting the quality of the summaries and mind maps.
