# Team Wiki & Knowledge Base

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** As teams grow, important information and processes get scattered across Google Docs, Slack messages, and individual employees' heads. This makes it hard for new hires to get up to speed and for existing team members to find the information they need.

**Solution:** A structured and easy-to-navigate Notion template for building a company-wide knowledge base or wiki. It includes pre-built structures for different departments, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and a powerful search-friendly layout.

**Target Users:** Small to medium-sized businesses, startups, and remote teams.
