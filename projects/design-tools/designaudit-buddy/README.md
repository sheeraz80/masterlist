# DesignAudit Buddy

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Large design files often accumulate inconsistent styles and spacing errors, making design systems hard to maintain. This leads to quality issues and wasted time hunting down deviations.

**Solution:** An automated Figma plugin that scans a file for style inconsistencies (e.g. unaligned spacing, missing text styles) and suggests one-click fixes to enforce design system rules.

**Target Users:** UX/UI design teams and design system managers in mid-to-large organizations who need to ensure consistency across collaborators.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium plugin – basic scanning free, with a Pro plan unlocking batch fixes and custom rule definitions (e.g. company-specific style guides).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: ~$800/month; Realistic: ~$3,000/month; Optimistic: ~$8,000/month (assuming 50–500 teams pay $10–$20 monthly).

## Development Time
~5 days with AI assistance (leveraging Figma’s Plugin API for scanning nodes and a rules engine).

## Technical Complexity
4/10 – Mainly iterating through Figma document objects and comparing against defined style constants. Uses built-in Figma API calls; complexity is in defining flexible rule sets and a clean UI, which is manageable within a week.

## Competition Level
Medium – existing free tools like “Design Lint” check for missing styles, but our tool adds auto-fix and custom rule features. Most current solutions are open-source with limited functionality, so a polished premium option faces moderate competition.

## Key Features
- Automated detection of inconsistent text, color, and spacing styles across all frames
- One-click “fix all” to apply the nearest library style or uniform spacing
- Custom rule builder for specific brand guidelines (e.g. permitted font sizes)
- Summary report highlighting components that violate design system standards
- Offline operation within Figma (no server needed), ensuring privacy of design data

## Success Indicators
Number of active installs and files scanned per month; reduction in design inconsistencies post-scan (as reported by users); conversion rate from free to paid users; monthly recurring revenue from Pro subscriptions; user feedback citing time saved on QA.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** Yes
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
