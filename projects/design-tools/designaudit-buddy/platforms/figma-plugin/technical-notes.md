# DesignAudit Buddy - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10 – Mainly iterating through Figma document objects and comparing against defined style constants. Uses built-in Figma API calls; complexity is in defining flexible rule sets and a clean UI, which is manageable within a week.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days with AI assistance (leveraging Figma’s Plugin API for scanning nodes and a rules engine).

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An automated Figma plugin that scans a file for style inconsistencies (e.g. unaligned spacing, missing text styles) and suggests one-click fixes to enforce design system rules.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
