# MockupMaker (Device Mockup Generator) - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Presenting designs in realistic device frames (like an iPhone mockup, or a browser window around a web design) is a common task for portfolios, client presentations, or marketing assets. Designers currently either manually place screenshots into mockup files or use external tools to generate these device previews. It’s extra work switching contexts.

### Target Market
UI/UX designers preparing client presentations or dribbble/portfolio shots, marketing designers wanting product images, and freelancers who need to quickly deliver device previews.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium – There are some Figma community files and plugins for mockups (e.g., “Angle” plugin that places screens in 3D device shapes, which had free and paid aspects). Angle is popular for angled 3D device renders. Our approach can include flat and angled, but if Angle is established, we might differentiate with ease or more templates. Also people use external sites (smartmockups, etc.). But keeping in Figma is a plus. Competition means we should either be cheaper or have unique devices (maybe more updated models or customization).

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase per user (~$20) with possibly expansions (maybe charge extra packs of device templates). The value is clear per use and doesn’t necessarily need ongoing subscription unless we keep adding content (which we could as updates).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/month; Realistic: $1,000/month; Optimistic: $4,000/month. Many designers do mockups frequently. If we tap into even the Dribbble crowd who love fancy presentations, that’s a decent market. There are free resources, but paying for convenience inside Figma is appealing. Optimistic if it becomes a standard tool for agencies delivering polished outputs.

- **Realistic:** 1,000/month
- **Optimistic:** 4,000/month

### Monetization Strategy
Market via channels like Dribbble or Behance communities – highlight how quickly one can get beautiful device mockups without leaving Figma. We can show side-by-side of a raw screenshot vs. a polished mockup image and ask “Which has more impact?” Many will pay to save fiddling with Photoshop or Sketch mockups. Also, emphasize always-updated device models (when new iPhone comes out, we’ll update library – included in purchase), whereas static kits might get outdate】. For agencies, the consistency and speed in delivering client showcase images is a selling point. We might also upsell packs if needed (but simpler to include many in base price).

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Asset licensing: We must use device images we have rights to. Possibly create our own stylized device illustrations to avoid trademark issues (Apple devices shape can be sensitive – but many kits exist, presumably okay if generic silhouette). We will ensure they are non-branded (no logos) but recognizable outlines. Competition: If Angle plugin covers much, we need to stand out on either price or simplicity. Angle was a one-time purchase of a library I recall; now maybe integrated in a plugin. We can differentiate by focusing on mainstream use (no complex 3D, just clean marketing-ready outputs easily). Quality: If the plugin mis-scales or outputs slightly blurry images, designers will complain as they are detail-oriented. We'll test and perhaps allow user to adjust scale if needed to get pixel-perfect. Figma doesn’t distort images well (no perspective transform), so angled outputs might be done by pre-distorting the screen content to match perspective – which we could approximate by skewing and scaling (not true perspective but might pass for slight angles). We should possibly avoid extreme 3D and stick to safe angles or front view to ensure crispness. Adoption: Many might try to do it themselves with free mockup files. We show that integrated plugin is a smoother workflow (no switching software). Once tried, hopefully they see value in regained time.

## Success Indicators
Number of mockups generated (if users keep using it for every project, that’s great). The presence of our mockups in the wild (maybe we see a particular style of device frame being used widely, indicating our plugin’s output). Customer reviews like “This saved me from buying a Photoshop action or doing it manually.” Also, if after each Apple event we see an uptick because new device frames are in demand and we supply them quickly, that’s a niche success (timely updates driving sales).
