# MockupMaker (Device Mockup Generator) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 3/10 – The main challenge is maintaining quality and correct scaling. E.g., an iPhone X screen is a certain pixel size; we need to scale the design into the device overlay correctly. If resolution differences, ensure output isn’t blurry (maybe export at 2x). Figma can handle overlay images well. Possibly minor math to place for angled templates (Angle plugin uses perspective transforms which Figma can’t natively do except via distort which is tricky; maybe we stick to flat front-facing for simplicity, or provide multiple pre-angled images and just place flat design and skew it visually – not perfect without actual transform). Might just avoid heavy 3D transforms, focus on flat and pseudo-3D side-by-side or rotated views.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. We need a library of device frame images or SVGs (phones of various models, desktops, maybe perspective 3D styles). Could either bundle a set (ensure license to use these visuals) or generate simple ones (browser chrome drawn in vector, etc.). The plugin then takes the selected frame, scales it appropriately, and masks it into the device image. Possibly add background, reflection, drop shadow options. Technically layering an image over a frame or vice versa in Figma is straightforward (we can create a new frame with the composition). The user may need the final as an exported PNG, so provide export. Possibly allow custom device images uploaded by user. Complexity is moderate asset management.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A Figma plugin that instantly wraps a selected frame with a high-fidelity device mockup. For example, take a mobile app screen and render it inside an iPhone image with a shadow, or put a website design inside a browser window graphic with a URL bar. It can output these as new frames or export images ready to share. Essentially, automating the process of creating showcase mockups from designs.
