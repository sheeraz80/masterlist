# MockupMaker (Device Mockup Generator) - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
UI/UX designers preparing client presentations or dribbble/portfolio shots, marketing designers wanting product images, and freelancers who need to quickly deliver device previews.

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase per user (~$20) with possibly expansions (maybe charge extra packs of device templates). The value is clear per use and doesn’t necessarily need ongoing subscription unless we keep adding content (which we could as updates).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/month; Realistic: $1,000/month; Optimistic: $4,000/month. Many designers do mockups frequently. If we tap into even the Dribbble crowd who love fancy presentations, that’s a decent market. There are free resources, but paying for convenience inside Figma is appealing. Optimistic if it becomes a standard tool for agencies delivering polished outputs.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Market via channels like Dribbble or Behance communities – highlight how quickly one can get beautiful device mockups without leaving Figma. We can show side-by-side of a raw screenshot vs. a polished mockup image and ask “Which has more impact?” Many will pay to save fiddling with Photoshop or Sketch mockups. Also, emphasize always-updated device models (when new iPhone comes out, we’ll update library – included in purchase), whereas static kits might get outdate】. For agencies, the consistency and speed in delivering client showcase images is a selling point. We might also upsell packs if needed (but simpler to include many in base price).

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
