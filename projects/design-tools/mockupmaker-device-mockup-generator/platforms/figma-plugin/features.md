# MockupMaker (Device Mockup Generator) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Device library: Variety of device frames (latest iPhones in different colors, Android phone, tablet, laptop, generic browser window). Also fun ones like watch or TV if needed. User selects which mockup style from a gallery in the plugin.
- Auto-fit and styling: The plugin places the selected design into the mockup at correct aspect ratio, adding common embellishments (glare effect, drop shadow around device, background color or gradient if none). Possibly allow minor adjustments (scale up/down if needed, choose background).
- Multiple device layouts: Ability to create a composition (like multiple devices in one frame) e.g. generate a phone and a laptop side by side with the design in each, for showcasing responsive design. Template for that would be pre-made. The plugin just injects the userâ€™s mobile screen and desktop screen into the composite mockup layout.
- Export ready: After generation, allow one-click export of the mockup as PNG at high resolution (e.g. 3x for print or retina). Also keep the Figma frame so user can tweak or add text labels if needed.
- Custom imports (Pro): Perhaps let Pro users import their own device frame images (like a branded device frame or an older model not in library) and the plugin will fit designs into them similarly. This adds flexibility beyond our provided set.
