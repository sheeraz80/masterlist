# Code Snippet Manager

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers constantly reuse code snippets (functions, configurations, commands). Storing them in text files or gists is disorganized and inefficient.

**Solution:** A browser-based code snippet manager designed for developers. It allows users to save, tag, search, and quickly copy code snippets from a clean, organized interface.

**Target Users:** Software developers, DevOps engineers, and data scientists.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.2/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium (with sync).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $4,500/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
4/10. The UI is the main component. All data is stored locally in for the free version. The backend for the Pro sync feature can be built on a simple serverless database like Firebase.

## Competition Level
Medium. Desktop tools like Pieces and web apps like Gist exist. The niche for a browser extension is the ability to quickly save snippets from anywhere on the web (e.g., Stack Overflow, tutorials) and have them instantly available in the browser.

## Key Features
- Quick Save: Highlight code on any webpage and save it as a snippet with one click.
- Rich Editor: A proper code editor with syntax highlighting for creating and editing snippets.
- Tagging & Search: Organize snippets with tags and find them instantly with full-text search.
- Language Detection: Automatically detects and applies the correct syntax highlighting for the code.
- Cloud Sync (Pro): Sync snippets across all your devices.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and the number of snippets saved by the user base.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
