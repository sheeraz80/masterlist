# PersonaPalette (AI Image & Icon Finder) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Unified search bar: Enter a term, choose filter (Photos, Icons, or AI Generate).
- Stock photo integration: Fetch results from Unsplash/Pexels with thumbnails; clicking one inserts the image at either a preset size or into a selected shapeâ€™s fill.
- Icon search: Search across libraries (e.g. Material Icons, FontAwesome) and get SVG icons inserted as vector shapes (preserving editability). Possibly allow coloring the icon upon insert to match a selected color.
- AI image generation (Pro): Input a prompt, choose a style or aspect ratio, get an AI-generated image and insert. Provide a few variations if possible. Limit usage per day unless subscribed to manage cost.
- Favorites/History: Option to save frequently used assets or see recent searches for convenience.
