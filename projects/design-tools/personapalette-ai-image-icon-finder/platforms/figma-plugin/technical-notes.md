# PersonaPalette (AI Image & Icon Finder) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10 – The search and API calls are fine. The hardest part is dealing with the results display in plugin UI and inserting assets efficiently. Also, handling AI generation: dealing with latency (show a loading indicator while image generates), possibly errors if inappropriate or if it fails. Also ensuring we abide by usage rights – Unsplash is free for commercial, icons depend on source (we’d pick open license libraries). AI images – need to clarify they are AI generated (some policies might require it). So complexity lies partly in UX and partly in ethical considerations.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Integrating with Unsplash API (straightforward), iconify API for icons (straightforward), and an AI image API like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion via a free tier or requiring user’s API key. Without running our server, we can call something like Stability AI’s endpoint (user would need their API key or use a limited free key we bundle). The plugin UI for search and results needs to be smooth (thumbnail gallery, etc.). With modern web tech and maybe some caching in plugin, doable.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that combines an image finder/generator and an icon search in one. It lets you search a keyword (e.g. “smiling businesswoman” or “secure icon”) and either fetches a free stock image (from Unsplash/Pexels API) or generates one via an AI image API if something specific is needed. For icons, it can search icon libraries (like FontAwesome or iconify). The user can then insert the chosen asset directly into Figma in the selected shape or as a new layer. This saves time jumping between websites.
