# Vault Visualizer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Obsidian's graph view is powerful but can become an unreadable "hairball" in large vaults. It lacks advanced filtering, clustering, and coloring options to help users find meaningful patterns in their knowledge graph.

**Solution:** An advanced graph analysis and visualization plugin that provides powerful filtering and layout options, allowing users to explore their vault's structure in new ways.

**Target Users:** Power users, visual thinkers, and anyone with a large vault trying to make sense of their connections.
