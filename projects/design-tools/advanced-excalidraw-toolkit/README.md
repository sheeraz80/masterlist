# Advanced Excalidraw Toolkit

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The Excalidraw plugin is incredibly popular for sketching and diagramming, but it lacks libraries of pre-made shapes and templates for specific domains like software architecture, flowcharts, or UI wireframing.

**Solution:** A companion plugin for Excalidraw that adds a new panel with extensive libraries of pre-made shapes, icons, and templates for various professional use cases.

**Target Users:** Software engineers, product managers, UI/UX designers, and systems thinkers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.2/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase with add-on packs.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $11,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
4/10. The plugin would consist of a large library of Excalidraw-compatible shape files (.excalidraw). The UI would be a simple panel that allows users to browse these libraries and drag-and-drop shapes onto their active drawing.

## Competition Level
Low. This enhances one of Obsidian's most popular plugins rather than competing with it, solving a common user request.

## Key Features
- Shape Libraries: Extensive libraries for software architecture (AWS, GCP icons), flowcharts, UML diagrams, and UI wireframes.
- Drag-and-Drop: Easily drag shapes from the library panel onto the Excalidraw canvas.
- Template Library: Full templates for common diagrams (e.g., a complete sequence diagram, a user flow template).
- Custom Library Support: Users can add their own collections of shapes to the library.
- Searchable Libraries: Quickly search for a specific icon or shape across all libraries.

## Success Indicators
Total sales of the core toolkit and add-on packs.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
