# LayerSage (Auto-Organize & Name) - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Large Figma files often get disorganized – layer names like “Rectangle 123” or random grouping, making it hard to navigate or hand off to others. Cleaning up layers by grouping logically and renaming (e.g. “Header/Bg”, “Button/Icon”) is tedious but important for team collaboration.

### Target Market
Designers working in teams or handing files to developers, design ops people who maintain library hygiene, and anyone inheriting a messy file who wants to tidy it up quickly.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low – There are a few plugins like “Rename It” (for batch renaming with find/replace) and “AutoGrid” or “tidy up” features in Figma (just aligns). But no holistic solution that intelligently groups and names semantically. So mostly unique. However, some designers might be wary letting a plugin rearrange layers in case it breaks prototypes or constraints. So trust-building and maybe partial application (preview changes) is needed.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase (~$15) or Freemium (basic grouping free, advanced AI naming in Pro). Probably one-time suits since it’s a utility used periodically. Teams might buy a few copies if they value cleanliness.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $200/month; Realistic: $800/month; Optimistic: $2,500/month. Many know the pain of messy files; the question is will they pay or just manually fix? If we show huge time savings on a complex file, many pros would pay. Optimistic if some large teams make it part of their process (like always run LayerSage before committing library files).

- **Optimistic:** 2,500/month

### Monetization Strategy
Market as a time-saver and professionalism booster: a well-organized file is a hallmark of a pro (reduces developer confusion, speeds up design updates). Many senior designers have horror stories of messy file】. Use those anecdotes in marketing (“Don’t be that designer with ‘Rectangle 99’s everywhere – LayerSage fixes it in seconds.”). For teams, it could be part of QA: run it before sharing files. We could outreach to design ops folks who love anything that standardizes work. Perhaps offer a free trial for one page so they see the effect.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Acceptance risk: Designers may fear it could mess up auto-layout or component overrides. We mitigate by careful coding: e.g. skip grouping if frames use auto-layout heavily (or ensure grouping doesn’t detach components). Also emphasise the preview and undo to show it’s safe. AI accuracy: If we attempt identifying icons with AI, errors could be embarrassing (naming a search icon as “O” or something). Might avoid heavy AI, or only use it for minor hints, leaning on safer rules and perhaps user input (like highlight layers and let user tell plugin “These are all icons – name by library name”). Competition: People might just not care and live with messy layers, especially if working solo. Our angle is showing the downstream impact (ease of updates, others understanding). For adoption, perhaps give some free usage or guarantee no-harm to overcome reluctance. Technical: We must test on complex real-world files to avoid breaking constraints. Also ensure not to rename master components or variants in ways that break instances (maybe limit to within frames, not global component names unless asked).

## Success Indicators
A tangible measure: reduction in time spent organizing files – maybe user testimonials like “It cleaned a 100-screen app file in 2 minutes, would’ve taken me a day.” Also, if the plugin becomes recommended in company onboarding (“Use LayerSage to keep files clean, as per our guidelines”), that’s great penetration. Monitoring how often it’s used per file could indicate value: e.g. designers might run it at project end or regularly. Fewer frustrated remarks about messy layers from developers might be indirect evidence if used widely in a team.
