# LayerSage (Auto-Organize & Name) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Intelligent grouping: Option to “Group related layers” – e.g. wrap label and input rectangle into a “Input Field” group, or all nav icons into a “Navbar” frame. It might offer suggestions for group names (“Group these 3 layers as ‘Card/ListItem’?”) that user can accept.
- Batch renaming: Identify layers with default names and rename them based on their role. For example, a layer that is an image often can be named “Image/[contents or category]”. Text layers can be named by their text content truncated (a layer with text “Sign In” named “Txt_SignIn”). Provide consistent prefixes for types (like “Btn_…”, “Icon/…”) according to a chosen convention.
- Apply naming convention: If a team uses “slash naming” for variants (like “Button/Primary/Enabled”), the plugin can enforce casing and delimiter rules. E.g. change all spaces to camelCase or slashes as configured.
- Cleanup: Remove unused layers or stray points (sometimes files have invisible stray elements). Also, optionally re-order layers in the list in a logical top-to-bottom or z-index order. This just tidies for human reading; Figma’s visual is unchanged but it’s nicer for someone examining layer list.
- Preview and Undo: Show a summary of changes (e.g. “Rename Rectangle 45 -> Card Background; Group 3 layers into Group ‘Header’”). User can uncheck any suggestion before applying. And one-click undo if layout breaks. This builds user trust.
