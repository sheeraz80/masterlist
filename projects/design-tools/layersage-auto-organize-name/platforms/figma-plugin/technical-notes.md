# LayerSage (Auto-Organize & Name) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10 – Grouping layers programmatically without messing up constraints or component structures is tricky. We must ensure if we create a group, we don’t disrupt auto-layout or component definitions – maybe limit to frames where grouping won’t break layout. Or only rename and not group if auto-layout present. Renaming is easier (just changing name property). Using AI for icon naming means extracting image data and calling an API like Azure Vision or custom model, possible but adds to cost. We could stick to using existing layer name or library info (if an icon is from a known set, might already have a name). The complexity is mostly in not screwing up the file integrity while improving it.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~6 days. The logic includes: scanning layers for patterns (text above rectangle often = button), proximity-based grouping (elements that overlap to form a component), and making decisions on grouping. That can be rule-based initially. For naming, we could use some heuristics (if a text layer says “Login”, name group “Button/Login” etc.). Possibly call an AI for suggestion if content isn’t obvious (like a vector icon could be identified via an AI vision API to name it “Icon/Home” for a home icon). That’s a stretch goal. Without AI, we rely on layer type and styles to guess (“Layer with 8px stroke and no fill likely ‘Divider’ line”). AI assistance can help code but also maybe we can use an image recognition API for icons. Complexity moderate.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that uses smart rules to auto-organize the layers and structure. It can group layers that form a component (e.g. detect a rectangle and label text as a “button” group) and suggest meaningful names based on their content or design function (possibly using a bit of AI/NLP on the layer properties). It can also apply a consistent naming convention (like Title Case or slashes for hierarchy) across the fil 】. Think of it as a linter/formatter for Figma layers.
