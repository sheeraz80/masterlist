# LayerSage (Auto-Organize & Name) - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Designers working in teams or handing files to developers, design ops people who maintain library hygiene, and anyone inheriting a messy file who wants to tidy it up quickly.

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase (~$15) or Freemium (basic grouping free, advanced AI naming in Pro). Probably one-time suits since it’s a utility used periodically. Teams might buy a few copies if they value cleanliness.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $200/month; Realistic: $800/month; Optimistic: $2,500/month. Many know the pain of messy files; the question is will they pay or just manually fix? If we show huge time savings on a complex file, many pros would pay. Optimistic if some large teams make it part of their process (like always run LayerSage before committing library files).

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Market as a time-saver and professionalism booster: a well-organized file is a hallmark of a pro (reduces developer confusion, speeds up design updates). Many senior designers have horror stories of messy file】. Use those anecdotes in marketing (“Don’t be that designer with ‘Rectangle 99’s everywhere – LayerSage fixes it in seconds.”). For teams, it could be part of QA: run it before sharing files. We could outreach to design ops folks who love anything that standardizes work. Perhaps offer a free trial for one page so they see the effect.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
