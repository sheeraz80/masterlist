# A11y Analyzer (Accessibility Assistant) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Touch target check: Flag any interactive-looking element (buttons, icons inside clickable areas) that is smaller than, say, 44x44 px (the Apple guideline) or too close to another tap target. Could highlight them in red overlays.
- Spacing and zoom: Warn if text is very small (below 12px for body text, as that may be hard to read, or below 16px which is recommended for web), because that affects readability.
- Color blindness simulator: Choose a type of color vision deficiency (e.g. protanopia) and the plugin will show a simulation (maybe by duplicating the frame or applying a filter) to let the designer visually check if information is still distinguishable without color cues.
- Screen reader outline (Pro): Generate a structured outline of all text and images in the order a screen reader might read them. E.g. list frames/artboards as separate pages with their content listed (we’d infer reading order either by layer order or coordinates). This helps designers see if, for example, they have meaningful labels for icons or if the reading order is logical.
- Alt-text reminders: Identify images or icons that likely need alt text and ensure there’s a text layer nearby that could serve as alt (or flag if not). This could be as simple as highlighting images that have no descriptive text.
- Report export: Generate an audit report listing all issues found (like “Button X is only 30px high – too small for tap” or “Color contrast of text Y on background Z is 3:1, below recommended”). Pro users might get a nicely formatted PDF/Markdown to share with QA or devs.
