# A11y Analyzer (Accessibility Assistant) - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
UX/UI designers concerned with accessibility, product designers in regulated industries that mandate accessible design, and design leads who want to ensure their team’s output meets standards (WCAG) before handing to dev. Many organizations now prioritize inclusive design, so this fits that trend.

### Revenue Model
Freemium with a likely focus on teams (maybe even enterprise pricing if we got traction). Basic checks (like tap size and contrast – though contrast we did separate plugin, but maybe basic included here too) can be free. Pro version ($10/month or $99/year per seat) includes advanced simulations (color blindness filters, screen reader outline generation, PDF of report, etc.). Possibly offer team licenses at a discount for companies.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/month; Realistic: $1,500/month; Optimistic: $5,000+/month. Accessibility is increasingly a requirement, and a tool that saves time in auditing designs could justify company spend. The optimistic scenario could happen if several mid-size companies adopt it for all designers (like 50 designers paying $99 each annually adds up). It’s somewhat niche but with strong impetus (legal compliance in some cases).

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Emphasize risk and responsibility: “Avoid accessibility bugs early – catch them in design.” Many companies face lawsuits or user complaints if a11y is poor; framing this tool as reducing those risks and dev rework can justify the cost. We can reference the growing focus on inclusive design (market trend). Possibly collaborate with accessibility advocates or orgs to endorse it. The free part draws in individuals (esp. contrast sim which even Stark offers free basics) and the Pro is targeted at serious teams. If Stark is known, we might present as a more comprehensive alternative or complementary (they also have a paid version for ~$60/year for a suite). We need to ensure enough unique value beyond what Stark does (they do contrast, colorblind sim, and focus order but to what extent?). Perhaps pricing similarly or slightly lower for competition.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
