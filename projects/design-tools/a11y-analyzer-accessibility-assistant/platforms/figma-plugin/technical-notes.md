# A11y Analyzer (Accessibility Assistant) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10 – Some aspects like analyzing touch target sizes means scanning for components that look like buttons (maybe based on layer naming or type) and measuring them – we might need heuristics. Colorblind filter: applying a matrix to colors or exporting image and modifying might be heavy if done in plugin (maybe just approximate by adjusting colors, or request user to visually inspect via filter CSS in plugin UI?). Screen reader sim: would require reading text layers in order – could attempt to output a text outline of the screen by traversing layers (assuming reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom from canvas coordinates or layer order). That’s complex to perfect. Possibly an iterative approach where initial version focuses on easier checks (size, contrast, maybe colorblind filter) and later adds others.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Some checks are straightforward (size measurements, color checks reuse code from contrast plugin). Color blindness simulation can be done by applying filters to frames (we might generate an image of the frame and shift colors). Generating a screen reader outline is tricky: we could use layer structure (frames as landmarks, etc.). Perhaps integrate basic rules from WCAG guidelines (like ensure headings vs body text contrast, etc.). The complexity is medium due to variety of checks. AI could assist e.g. summarizing a screen’s content order, but not necessary.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An accessibility auditing plugin for Figma. It would check things like: Are interactive elements (buttons, icons) at least X pixels in size? Are form controls labeled (designers might leave placeholder text which could be ambiguous)? Are color combinations colorblind-friendly (simulate color blindness on the design)? It can simulate how a screen reader would linearize the content (based on layer order/naming), flagging if something might not make sense. Essentially a toolkit to catch potential a11y issues early in the design.
