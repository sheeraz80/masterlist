# Web Page to PDF Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users often need to save web pages as PDFs for archiving, sharing, or offline reading. The browser's built-in "Print to PDF" function is often clunky, poorly formatted, and doesn't handle complex layouts well.

**Solution:** A one-click extension that creates a clean, well-formatted, and customizable PDF from any webpage.

**Target Users:** Professionals, students, researchers, and anyone who needs to archive web content.
