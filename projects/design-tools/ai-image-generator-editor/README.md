# AI Image Generator & Editor

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Content creators and marketers need quick access to unique images for blog posts, social media, and presentations. Using stock photos can be generic, and dedicated AI image tools require leaving the current workflow.

**Solution:** A browser extension that provides a powerful AI image generator and editor in a sidebar. Users can generate images from a text prompt, edit existing images on a webpage, or create variations of an image with one click.

**Target Users:** Content creators, marketers, bloggers, and social media managers.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $7,000/mo; Optimistic: $25,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension's UI would be a sidebar. It would integrate with one or more AI image generation APIs (like OpenAI's DALL-E 3 or Stability AI). The user provides their own API key to manage costs.

## Competition Level
Medium. There are many web-based AI image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E. The value proposition is the convenience of having these tools available on any webpage, allowing for in-context creation and editing.

## Key Features
- Text-to-Image Generation: Create images from a simple text prompt.
- In-Painting & Out-Painting: Select an area of an existing image on a webpage and use AI to edit or expand it.
- Style Variations: Generate variations of an image in different artistic styles (e.g., photorealistic, cartoon, watercolor).
- Image Upscaling: Increase the resolution of low-quality images.
- Personal Asset Library: Save generated images to a personal library for later use.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales, number of images generated, and user shares of their creations.
