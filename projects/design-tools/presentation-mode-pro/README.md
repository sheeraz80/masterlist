# Presentation Mode Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While Figma's built-in presentation mode is functional, it lacks features common in dedicated presentation tools like Keynote or PowerPoint, such as speaker notes, a timer, or an audience-facing pointer.

**Solution:** A plugin that enhances Figma's presentation mode by adding a "presenter view" controller (that can be opened on a second screen or phone) with speaker notes, a slide navigator, and a timer.

**Target Users:** Designers, product managers, and sales teams who use Figma to create and deliver presentations.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $6,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
The real-time communication between the plugin and the presenter view controller is the main technical hurdle. Platform Risk: Figma could decide to significantly upgrade its own presentation mode at any time.

## Competition Level
Low. Plugins like Pitchdeck exist but focus on exporting to other formats. This tool focuses on improving the native Figma presentation experience.

## Key Features
- Presenter View Controller: A separate window showing the current slide, next slide, speaker notes, and a timer.
- Speaker Notes: Automatically pulls text from the description field of each presentation frame to be used as speaker notes.
- Presentation Timer: A customizable timer with alerts to help presenters stay on track.
- Virtual Laser Pointer: Allows the presenter to show a "laser pointer" on the main presentation screen, controlled from the presenter view.
- Audience Polls/Q&A (Pro Feature): Embed simple polls or a Q&A feed into the presentation.

## Success Indicators
Total sales, Pro subscriptions, and positive reviews from users who present regularly.
