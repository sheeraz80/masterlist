# Code Style Enforcer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Tools like Prettier enforce code formatting, but they don't enforce code style or best practices (e.g., avoiding prop drilling in React, using specific design patterns). These are typically caught later in code review.

**Solution:** An advanced linter that goes beyond formatting to detect "code smells" and anti-patterns specific to popular frameworks, suggesting better, more maintainable alternatives.

**Target Users:** Mid-to-senior level developers, tech leads, and teams focused on long-term code maintainability.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $6,000/mo; Optimistic: $22,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
Building and maintaining robust, accurate linting rules for multiple frameworks is a massive undertaking. Opinionated Nature: Code style is subjective. The tool's opinions might not align with every team's preferences, making customizability key.

## Competition Level
Medium. ESLint with custom rule sets can achieve some of this, but it requires significant configuration. This tool would come pre-packaged with expert-defined rule sets for major frameworks.

## Key Features
- Framework-Specific Rule Sets: Pre-packaged, opinionated rule sets for React, Vue, Angular, etc.
- Code Smell Detection: Identifies common issues like "prop drilling," "massive components," "magic strings," etc.
- Automated Refactoring Suggestions: Offers quick-fix actions to refactor problematic code into a better pattern.
- Custom Rule Builder (Pro): A UI for teams to define their own custom code style rules.
- In-Editor Explanations: Provides clear explanations of why a certain pattern is considered a "smell" and links to best practice documentation.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active teams, and testimonials about improved code quality and faster code reviews.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
