# Code Style Enforcer - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Tools like Prettier enforce code formatting, but they don't enforce code style or best practices (e.g., avoiding prop drilling in React, using specific design patterns). These are typically caught later in code review.

### Target Market
Mid-to-senior level developers, tech leads, and teams focused on long-term code maintainability.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. ESLint with custom rule sets can achieve some of this, but it requires significant configuration. This tool would come pre-packaged with expert-defined rule sets for major frameworks.
