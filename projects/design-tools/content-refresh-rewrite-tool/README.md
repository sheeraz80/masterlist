# Content Refresh & Rewrite Tool

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** SEO best practices require that old blog content be periodically updated and refreshed to maintain its search ranking. Manually rewriting old articles is a low-priority task that often gets neglected.

**Solution:** An AI tool that takes the URL of an old blog post, scrapes its content, and uses a Jasper workflow to rewrite it. The workflow can be instructed to update outdated information, adopt a more modern tone, or optimize for a new target keyword.

**Target Users:** SEO managers, content marketers, and website owners.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. Requires a serverless function for scraping. The core is a Jasper prompt that instructs the AI to act as an editor refreshing an old article, with specific instructions provided by the user.

Medium. AI rewriters are common, but a tool specifically designed for the "content refresh" workflow with SEO goals is a strong niche.

## Key Features
- Automated Rewriting: Rewrites an entire article with one click.
- Targeted Refresh Goals: User can specify the goal: "Update outdated facts," "Make the tone more casual," or "Optimize for the keyword '[new keyword]'."
- Side-by-Side Diff Viewer: Shows the original text next to the rewritten version with changes highlighted.
- Plagiarism Check Integration: Includes a check to ensure the rewritten content is unique.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active subscribers, and case studies showing improved rankings for refreshed content.
