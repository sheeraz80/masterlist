# Design AI Assistant (UXCritique) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10 – Summarizing a visual design into text for AI is challenging. We might use Figma node tree: read layer names, types, maybe relative positions (“button below header text”). The AI might need this context to give specific feedback. Ensuring prompts are concise but thorough is an iterative process. Also, cost: each analysis could hit OpenAI API and cost fractions of a cent; must manage usage and not go bankrupt on free users. Possibly require user to input their API key in free version, or limit to small frames. The actual plugin logic is moderate.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days initial (leveraging an existing large language model like GPT via API). Most time spent on engineering how to describe the design to the AI: possibly create a prompt by listing frame elements (like “Screen has a header with text ‘Welcome’, two buttons labeled X and Y, etc.”). AI assistance in coding would help format this prompt. Then parsing AI response and showing it nicely in plugin UI. The heavy lift (the “knowledge”) is on the AI’s side, so our job is prompt engineering and UI.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An AI-powered plugin that analyzes a Figma frame or flow and provides suggestions or critiques. For example, it might flag if a button’s call-to-action text is ambiguous, or if an important element is too low contrast (beyond pure color contrast, maybe hierarchy). It could also suggest improvements like “Consider making this text larger for readability” or “This screen has many elements; consider simplifying.” The AI uses design best practices learned from large datasets to give written feedback, almost like a junior UX consultant inside Figma.
