# Design AI Assistant (UXCritique) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Automated critique: Click “Analyze Design” and the plugin outputs a list of observations/suggestions. E.g. “The primary button ‘Continue’ might be too small on mobile; ensure it meets touch size guidelines” or “There are two CTAs of equal weight, consider emphasizing one primary action”.
- Context selection: User can specify the type of app or user (like “This is a finance app for seniors”) to guide the AI’s critique focus. The plugin passes that context to the AI prompt for more tailored feedback (like accessibility for seniors, or security concerns for finance UI).
- AI chat Q&A (Pro): A mode where users can ask questions about their design: “What do you think about the navigation? Any suggestions?” and the AI, having the design context loaded, answers specifically. This two-way interaction is premium value.
- Issue highlighting: If possible, link feedback to elements (maybe by mentioning layer name or highlighting on canvas). For example, clicking a suggestion about a button could flash that button layer on the Figma canvas. This requires our plugin to map AI comment to a layer – we can attempt if we included layer name in prompt and AI references it.
- Learning improvements: Allow user to rate the suggestions so the system can learn what was useful. While not trivial to retrain the AI (since we rely on an external model), we could at least adjust prompt strategy based on feedback (or filter out obviously bad tips over time).
