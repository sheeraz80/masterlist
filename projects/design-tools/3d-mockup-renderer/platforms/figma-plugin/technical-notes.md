# 3D Mockup Renderer - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. This plugin would not be doing 3D rendering itself. It would have a library of pre-rendered mockup images (e.g., a PNG of a laptop with a transparent screen area). The plugin's job is to take the user's selected frame, rasterize it, apply perspective transformations, and place it perfectly into the transparent area of the mockup image.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that allows designers to select a Figma frame and instantly render it onto a high-quality 3D device mockup directly on the Figma canvas.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
