# 3D Mockup Renderer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Designers frequently need to present their UI designs within realistic device mockups (phones, laptops, tablets). This usually requires exporting the design and using a separate application like Photoshop or a dedicated mockup tool, which is an inefficient, multi-step process.

**Solution:** A plugin that allows designers to select a Figma frame and instantly render it onto a high-quality 3D device mockup directly on the Figma canvas.

**Target Users:** UI/UX designers, marketing designers, and agencies creating presentations and portfolio pieces.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium (with paid asset packs).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $8,000/mo; Optimistic: $25,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This plugin would not be doing 3D rendering itself. It would have a library of pre-rendered mockup images (e.g., a PNG of a laptop with a transparent screen area). The plugin's job is to take the user's selected frame, rasterize it, apply perspective transformations, and place it perfectly into the transparent area of the mockup image.

## Competition Level
Medium. Plugins like Mockuuups Studio and Angle offer this functionality, but often with a limited selection of free mockups and a push to a subscription. The opportunity is in offering a better library, more customization, or a different pricing model.

## Key Features
- Mockup Library: A searchable library of high-quality device mockups (iPhone, Android phones, MacBook, etc.).
- One-Click Apply: Select a frame and a mockup, and the plugin generates the final image.
- Perspective & Angle Control: For some mockups, allow slight adjustments to the angle and perspective.
- Custom Backgrounds: Easily place the final mockup on a custom color or image background.
- Scene Builder: An advanced feature to combine multiple mockups into a single presentation scene.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from mockup pack sales, number of active free users, and partnerships with other design asset creators.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
