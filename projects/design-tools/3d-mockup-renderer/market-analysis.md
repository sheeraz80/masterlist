# 3D Mockup Renderer - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Designers frequently need to present their UI designs within realistic device mockups (phones, laptops, tablets). This usually requires exporting the design and using a separate application like Photoshop or a dedicated mockup tool, which is an inefficient, multi-step process.

### Target Market
UI/UX designers, marketing designers, and agencies creating presentations and portfolio pieces.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Plugins like Mockuuups Studio and Angle offer this functionality, but often with a limited selection of free mockups and a push to a subscription. The opportunity is in offering a better library, more customization, or a different pricing model.
