# Brand Pattern Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating unique, seamless background patterns is a common task for brand and marketing designers. Doing this manually by arranging and repeating elements is tedious, and using external tools breaks the workflow.

**Solution:** A plugin that generates beautiful, seamless, and on-brand patterns from a set of user-provided components (like a logo or icons) and a color palette.

**Target Users:** Brand designers, marketing designers, and illustrators.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $7,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The core logic involves taking a selection of vector nodes, arranging them based on a chosen algorithm (e.g., grid, random scatter, wave), and then tiling the result to create a seamless pattern. This can be done programmatically by creating and positioning instances of the source components.

## Competition Level
Medium. Plugins like Magic Pattern and Noise & Texture exist, but there's room for a tool focused specifically on creating patterns from a user's own brand assets, with more control over the layout and randomization.

## Key Features
- Component Input: Select any set of Figma components or vectors to use as the pattern elements.
- Layout Algorithms: Choose from different pattern layouts: grid, offset grid, random scatter, hexagonal, etc.
- Randomization Controls: Sliders to control the randomness of element size, rotation, and opacity.
- Color Palette Integration: Automatically apply colors from a selected set of local color styles.
- Live Preview & Export: A live preview of the pattern within the plugin UI, with a button to export the final pattern as a fill-ready image or a vector frame.

## Success Indicators
MRR, Pro subscriber count, and a vibrant community gallery of user-created patterns.

## Additional Information
