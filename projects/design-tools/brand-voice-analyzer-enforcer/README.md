# Brand Voice Analyzer & Enforcer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Maintaining a consistent brand voice across a large team or multiple marketing channels is a huge challenge. New content often deviates from the established tone, style, and vocabulary, diluting the brand's identity.

**Solution:** A two-part tool. First, it analyzes a company's existing website or documents to automatically generate a detailed Brand Voice profile for Jasper. Second, it acts as a "linter" that checks new content against this profile, highlighting words, phrases, or sentence structures that are off-brand.

**Target Users:** Enterprise marketing teams, brand managers, and content agencies.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.2/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 4/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Jasper Canvas](./platforms/jasper-canvas/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,200/mo; Realistic: $15,000/mo; Optimistic: $60,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
7/10. The analysis part is complex, requiring an LLM to read a large amount of text and distill it into a set of rules and style attributes. The "linting" part requires sophisticated prompt engineering to compare new text against the established voice profile.

## Competition Level
Medium. This competes with enterprise-focused AI platforms like Writer. The opportunity is to provide a more accessible and Jasper-native solution.

## Key Features
- Automated Voice Profile Creation: Scans a website URL to create a Jasper Brand Voice profile, identifying key attributes like tone, formality, and common jargon.
- Real-Time Content Linting: Analyzes new text and flags deviations from the brand voice.
- Style Guide Adherence: Checks for compliance with specific rules (e.g., "Always use 'customers' instead of 'users'").
- Rewrite Suggestions: Offers on-brand alternatives for flagged text.
- Team-Wide Integration: The brand voice profile can be shared across an entire team's Jasper account.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active teams, and case studies demonstrating improved brand consistency.
