# Isometric Scene Builder - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Creating isometric illustrations in Figma is a popular trend, but it can be technically challenging. Manually skewing and positioning each element to create a cohesive 3D scene is time-consuming and requires a high level of skill.

### Target Market
Illustrators, graphic designers, and UI designers creating marketing assets or product illustrations.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Plugins like Isometric and Fast Isometric exist, but there is an opportunity to create a more comprehensive "scene builder" with a richer feature set, better UI, and a library of assets.

- **Realistic:** 4,500/mo
- **Optimistic:** 15,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A freemium model to attract a wide user base of designers. Tiers: Free: Basic isometric conversion and grid generator. Pro ($10/month or $99/year): Scene management tools, expanded asset library, and the lighting/shadow helper. Acquisition: Showcase stunning isometric illustrations created with the plugin on Dribbble, Behance, and Instagram. Create time-lapse video tutorials for YouTube.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: The transformation math must be precise. Performance can be an issue when transforming very complex vector objects. Market Risk: Design trends change. While isometric design is currently popular, its longevity is not guaranteed. Mitigation is to build a brand around high-quality illustration tools, not just this one style.
