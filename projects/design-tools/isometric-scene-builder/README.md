# Isometric Scene Builder

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating isometric illustrations in Figma is a popular trend, but it can be technically challenging. Manually skewing and positioning each element to create a cohesive 3D scene is time-consuming and requires a high level of skill.

**Solution:** A plugin that simplifies the creation of isometric scenes by providing tools to instantly convert 2D layers to isometric projections and a library of pre-built isometric shapes and grids.

**Target Users:** Illustrators, graphic designers, and UI designers creating marketing assets or product illustrations.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $4,500/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The core math involves applying a transformation matrix to 2D vector nodes to project them onto an isometric plane. The plugin would offer presets for different projection angles (top, left, right). The complexity comes from building a user-friendly interface and managing an asset library.

## Competition Level
Medium. Plugins like Isometric and Fast Isometric exist, but there is an opportunity to create a more comprehensive "scene builder" with a richer feature set, better UI, and a library of assets.

## Key Features
- One-Click Conversion: Select any 2D shape or frame and convert it to a top, left, or right isometric projection.
- Isometric Grid Generator: Create customizable isometric grids on the canvas to guide layout.
- Scene Management: Tools to easily move objects along the isometric axes (X, Y, Z) instead of just free-form dragging.
- Asset Library: A built-in library of common isometric shapes (cubes, cylinders) and simple icons.
- Lighting and Shadow Helper: A simple tool to apply consistent highlights and shadows to objects to enhance the 3D effect.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and the volume of high-quality artwork shared by users on social media with a plugin-specific hashtag.
