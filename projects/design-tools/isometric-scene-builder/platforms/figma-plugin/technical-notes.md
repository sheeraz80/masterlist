# Isometric Scene Builder - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10. The core math involves applying a transformation matrix to 2D vector nodes to project them onto an isometric plane. The plugin would offer presets for different projection angles (top, left, right). The complexity comes from building a user-friendly interface and managing an asset library.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 5-6 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that simplifies the creation of isometric scenes by providing tools to instantly convert 2D layers to isometric projections and a library of pre-built isometric shapes and grids.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
