# Shopify Product Card Builder

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** E-commerce designers and agencies spend countless hours creating mockups for Shopify product pages, category pages, and marketing materials. Manually finding product images, titles, and prices and adding them to Figma is repetitive and slow.

**Solution:** A plugin that connects directly to a Shopify store via its API and allows designers to search for products and instantly generate product cards or page layouts using pre-designed Figma components.

**Target Users:** E-commerce design agencies, freelance designers specializing in Shopify, and in-house design teams at Shopify-based brands.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,200/mo; Realistic: $10,000/mo; Optimistic: $45,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires knowledge of the Shopify Storefront API. The user would create a private app on their store to generate an API key, which they input into the plugin. The plugin then fetches product data and maps it to Figma component layers, similar to the Airtable idea but for a different, lucrative niche.

## Competition Level
Very Low. This is a highly-niched "Data-to-Design" tool. No prominent solutions exist for this specific, high-value workflow.

## Key Features
- Shopify Store Connect: Securely connect to a store using a Storefront API access token.
- Product Search: A search bar within the plugin to find products in the connected store by name or SKU.
- Component Mapping: Define a "Product Card" component in Figma and map its layers (e.g., #Title, #Price, #Image) to Shopify product data fields.
- Instant Generation: Drag a product from the search results onto the canvas to create a fully populated product card component.
- Collection Population: Select a Shopify collection to automatically generate a grid of product cards for a category page mockup.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of agency clients, and testimonials from designers highlighting massive time savings.
