# Visual Storyboard Scripter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating visual content like explainer videos or ad campaigns requires a storyboard with both a visual description and a narrative script. Writing prompts for an AI image generator and writing the corresponding story text are two separate, disconnected steps.

**Solution:** A Jasper workflow that takes a simple story outline and generates a complete storyboard. For each scene, it produces both a detailed prompt for an AI image generator (like Jasper's own, or Midjourney) and the corresponding narrative text or voiceover script.

**Target Users:** Video creators, marketers, and advertising agencies.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.7/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Jasper Canvas](./platforms/jasper-canvas/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/mo; Realistic: $1,800/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
4/10. A chained Jasper prompt where the user's story outline is first broken into scenes, then for each scene, two separate prompts are run: one to generate an image prompt, and one to generate the narrative text.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a novel workflow that combines two different AI generation tasks into a single, cohesive output.

## Key Features
- Dual-Output Generation: Creates both image prompts and narrative script for each scene.
- Consistent Style: The AI is instructed to maintain a consistent visual style in the image prompts throughout the storyboard.
- Pacing Control: Users can specify the desired length of the video, and the AI will adjust the length of the script accordingly.
- Table Format Output: The storyboard is presented in a clean table with columns for "Scene #," "Visual Prompt," and "Narrative Script."
- Direct Image Generation (Pro): A premium version could directly integrate with Jasper's image generator to create the images alongside the prompts.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and users sharing the storyboards or videos created with the tool.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
