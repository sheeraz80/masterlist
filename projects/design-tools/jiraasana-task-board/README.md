# Jira/Asana Task Board

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers need to constantly switch between their code editor and their project management tool (like Jira or Asana) to view tasks, check requirements, and update their status. This context switching is inefficient.

**Solution:** An extension that adds a new panel to the VSCode activity bar showing the user's assigned tasks from Jira or Asana in a Kanban-style board. Users can view details and drag-and-drop tasks to update their status.

**Target Users:** Software developers and teams using Jira or Asana for project management.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $9,000/mo; Optimistic: $35,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires integration with the Jira or Asana REST APIs for authentication (OAuth 2.0 or API token) and data fetching. The UI would be a webview panel built with a framework like React or Vue.

## Competition Level
Medium. There are existing extensions for Jira and Asana, but many are limited in functionality or have a poor user experience. The opportunity is to create a highly polished, intuitive, and feature-rich integration.

## Key Features
- Kanban Board View: Displays assigned tasks in columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Drag-and-Drop Status Updates: Move cards between columns to update the task status in Jira/Asana.
- Task Detail View: Click a card to see the full task description, comments, and subtasks.
- Create New Tasks: A form to create new tasks in Jira/Asana without leaving VSCode.
- Time Tracking Integration (Pro): Start/stop a timer for a task, with the time logged back to Jira/Asana.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active teams subscribed, and user reviews highlighting productivity improvements.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
