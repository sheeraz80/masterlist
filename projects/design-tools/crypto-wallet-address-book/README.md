# Crypto Wallet Address Book

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users frequently send crypto to the same set of addresses (their own exchange deposit address, friends' wallets, etc.). Copying and pasting these long, complex addresses is tedious and carries the risk of making a mistake.

**Solution:** A simple, secure address book extension. Users can save and label frequently used wallet addresses and then quickly copy them or use them to pre-fill sending forms in dApps.
