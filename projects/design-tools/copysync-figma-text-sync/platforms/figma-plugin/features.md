# CopySync (Figma Text Sync) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Sheet-to-Figma import: Map text objects to spreadsheet cells by ID or position and update all at once (e.g. update all UX copy in a design with latest from a content doc)
- Figma-to-sheet export: Pull all text from selected frames or whole file into a CSV/Google Sheet (with identifiers), enabling copywriters to edit in a familiar environment
- Two-way sync: Preserve the mapping so that after writers edit and you refresh in Figma, text goes to the right place
- Multi-source support (Pro): Link different frames to different sheets or JSON endpoints (for apps with multiple content sources or multi-language support)
- Diff preview: Before applying updates, show what text will change (old vs new) so designers can review large content changes safely
