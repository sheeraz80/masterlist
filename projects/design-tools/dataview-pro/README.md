# Dataview Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The Dataview plugin is one of the most powerful tools in Obsidian, but its query language can be intimidating for non-technical users. Building complex tables and dashboards often requires a steep learning curve.

**Solution:** A "pro" version or companion plugin for Dataview that provides a graphical query builder. Users can use dropdowns and filters to construct complex queries without writing any code.

**Target Users:** All Obsidian users, especially those in project management, personal productivity, and anyone who wants to leverage their vault's metadata without coding.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.5/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin would be a UI wrapper that programmatically generates Dataview query syntax. The main work is in creating an intuitive UI for the query builder.

## Competition Level
Low. While Dataview is immensely popular, no major plugin exists to simplify its usage in this way. This solves a major pain point for a huge segment of the user base.

## Key Features
- Visual Query Builder: A step-by-step UI to select data sources (tags, folders), filter by properties, and choose display columns.
- Live Preview: See a live preview of the Dataview table as you build the query.
- Template Library: A library of pre-built queries for common use cases (e.g., "Uncompleted tasks," "Books to read," "Weekly review").
- Natural Language Input (AI-powered): An AI feature where a user can type "show me all notes tagged #book that I rated 5 stars" and it generates the Dataview query.
- Chart Generation: Integrated charting capabilities to visualize the query results as bar, line, or pie charts.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and becoming the "go-to" way for non-coders to use Dataview.

## Additional Information
