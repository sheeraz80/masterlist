# Prettier Playground - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Teams using Prettier often debate the optimal configuration settings (printWidth, tabWidth, etc.). Testing out different configurations requires editing the .prettierrc file and re-saving files, which is a slow feedback loop.

### Target Market
Development teams, open-source maintainers, and anyone setting up a new project's code style.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. The official Prettier website has a playground, but having it integrated directly into VSCode where the configuration actually matters is a much better workflow.

### Competitive Landscape
Low. The official Prettier website has a playground, but having it integrated directly into VSCode where the configuration actually matters is a much better workflow.
