# Extension Pack Manager

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Onboarding a new developer to a team often involves a long checklist of "required" VSCode extensions. Ensuring everyone has the same set of tools for a project is a manual process.

**Solution:** A utility that allows teams to define a collection of recommended and required extensions for a project in a simple config file. The extension then prompts users to install any missing extensions.

**Target Users:** Development teams, open-source project maintainers, and tech educators.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Free (with a potential for a paid team dashboard).

## Revenue Potential
Minimal direct revenue; focus on adoption and potential future team features.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. The extension would read a custom config file (e.g., .vscode/) from the project root. It would then use the VSCode API to check which extensions are installed and prompt the user to install any that are missing.

## Competition Level
Low. VSCode has a built-in "Recommended Extensions" feature, but it's not as powerful or configurable as a dedicated management tool could be.

## Key Features
- Configuration File: Define required and recommended extensions in a simple JSON file.
- Automatic Check: On project open, the extension checks for missing extensions and notifies the user.
- One-Click Install: A button to install all missing required extensions at once.
- Team Sync (Pro/Future): A web-based dashboard for team leads to manage extension packs for multiple projects, which then syncs down to the extension.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users/teams and positive feedback from team leads about smoother onboarding.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
