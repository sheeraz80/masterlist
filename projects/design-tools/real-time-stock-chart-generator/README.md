# Real-Time Stock Chart Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Designers working on fintech or investment app UIs need to create realistic and visually appealing stock charts. Using static, fake data looks unprofessional, and creating accurate charts manually is extremely difficult and time-consuming.

**Solution:** A plugin that uses a financial data API to generate beautiful, customizable stock charts (line, candlestick) for any public stock ticker, using real historical or mock data.

**Target Users:** UI/UX designers at fintech companies, trading platforms, and financial news websites.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium (API key model).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin itself is a client for a third-party financial data API (e.g., Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, which have free tiers). The user provides their own API key. The plugin's job is to take a ticker symbol, fetch the data, and then use the Figma API to draw the chart using vector paths and shapes.

## Competition Level
Medium. General chart plugins like Chart exist, but they are not specialized for financial data and often require users to provide their own data in CSV format. The value here is the seamless integration with a financial data source and presets for common financial chart types.

## Key Features
- Live Data Integration: Connects to financial data APIs to pull real historical stock data.
- Chart Types: Supports line charts, area charts, and candlestick charts.
- Customization: Control over colors (for up/down trends), timeframes (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y), and chart styles.
- Mock Data Generation: A feature to generate realistic-looking but random stock chart data for fictional companies.
- Interactive Regeneration: Easily update a chart by changing the ticker symbol or timeframe in the plugin UI.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and adoption by well-known fintech companies.
