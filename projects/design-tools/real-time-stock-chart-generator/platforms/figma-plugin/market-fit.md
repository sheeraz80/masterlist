# Real-Time Stock Chart Generator - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
UI/UX designers at fintech companies, trading platforms, and financial news websites.

### Revenue Model
Freemium (API key model).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A freemium model where the plugin is free, but advanced features and higher API usage limits require a subscription. This leverages the "bring your own API key" model. The subscription pays for the plugin's advanced functionality, not the data itself. Tiers: Free: Basic line charts, limited to 50 API calls per day using a shared, rate-limited key. Pro ($15/month): Candlestick charts, unlimited API calls (with user's own key), advanced styling options, and chart templates. Acquisition: Showcase stunning chart designs on Dribbble, target fintech design communities, and write blog posts on "Designing Data-Rich Financial Dashboards."

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
