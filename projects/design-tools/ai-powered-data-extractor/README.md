# AI-Powered Data Extractor

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Extracting structured data from websites (e.g., product listings, contact information, real estate data) is a common but tedious task for marketers, sales teams, and researchers. Existing scraper tools often require technical knowledge to configure.

**Solution:** An AI-powered browser extension where the user can simply highlight the data they want to extract on a page. The AI learns the structure and can then automatically extract the same data from similar pages with one click.

**Target Users:** Sales professionals, market researchers, recruiters, and data analysts.

- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $900/mo; Realistic: $8,000/mo; Optimistic: $30,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
7/10. This is technically challenging. It requires analyzing the DOM structure of the user's highlighted selection and using an LLM to create a robust "selector" or pattern that can be applied to other pages. This is a complex application of AI to web scraping.

## Competition Level
Medium. Tools like Browse AI offer this functionality, but often as part of a larger, more complex platform. The opportunity is a simple, user-friendly browser extension focused on this specific "show-and-scrape" workflow.

## Key Features
- Train by Example: Simply highlight the data you want on one page to train the scraper.
- One-Click Scraping: Navigate to a similar page and click "Scrape" to extract the data instantly.
- Multi-Page Scraping: Automatically navigate through multiple pages of a list (e.g., e-commerce search results) and scrape the data from each.
- Export to CSV/Google Sheets: Download the extracted data in a structured format.
- Scheduled Scraping (Pro): A premium feature to automatically run scrapes on a schedule and get notified of new data.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and the volume of data successfully extracted by users.

## Additional Information
