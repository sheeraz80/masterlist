# Path Intellisense Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The built-in Path Intellisense is useful for autocompleting file paths, but it doesn't know about path aliases configured in files like or .js. Developers have to remember and type these aliases manually.

**Solution:** A "pro" version of path intellisense that automatically parses common project configuration files (, , etc.) to provide autocompletion for path aliases (e.g., @/components/...).

**Target Users:** JavaScript and TypeScript developers working on medium to large projects.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $7,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension needs to find and parse configuration files like. It then needs to register a custom CompletionItemProvider with the VSCode API to provide the alias-based suggestions.

## Competition Level
Medium. Some framework-specific extensions might offer this, but a general-purpose tool that works across different project types is a strong niche.

## Key Features
- Alias Autocompletion: Provides intellisense for path aliases defined in , , etc.
- Automatic Detection: Automatically finds and reads the configuration files in the workspace root.
- Go to Definition: Ctrl+Clicking an aliased path navigates to the correct file.
- Multi-Framework Support: Works with configurations from Webpack, Vite, and the TypeScript compiler.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and positive reviews from developers working with modern JS/TS frameworks.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
