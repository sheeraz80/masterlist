# Airtable Content Sync - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10. Requires integration with the Airtable API for authentication (user provides their own API key) and data fetching. The core challenge is building an intuitive UI for mapping Airtable fields (e.g., "Name", "Profile Picture URL") to specific layers within a Figma component (e.g., a text layer named #Name, an image layer named #Avatar). All logic runs client-side.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.
