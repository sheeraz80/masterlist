# Figma2Notion (Design-to-Docs) - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Notion page generation: User selects frames, enters a Notion page ID or chooses to create new. The plugin exports each frame image and populates a nicely formatted Notion page (e.g. header = project name, then sections with image and frame name as subheader, and description placeholder).
- Update sync: Ability to update the Notion page later – e.g. if design changes, run plugin again and it will update the images on the existing page rather than duplicating (requires storing the mapping of frames to Notion blocks, which we can via the Notion block IDs saved in plugin data).
- Metadata capture: Include data like frame link (with a “Open in Figma” button), last updated timestamp, etc., so documentation stays contextual.
- Confluence support (maybe Pro): If feasible, allow similar export to Confluence Cloud via their API, since many enterprises use that. Could be a selling point.
- Authentication management: UI to input and securely store Notion integration token (in plugin settings, stored locally or in file data but encrypted perhaps).
