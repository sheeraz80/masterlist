# Figma2Notion (Design-to-Docs) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10 – Dealing with the Notion API (auth flow and formatting content in their JSON structure) is a bit of work, but the scope is limited: just placing images and text. Possibly have to host images? Notion API might require an image URL; if so, we might have to upload images to a storage (this would break zero-server if we need our own storage). However, we can possibly use Notion’s ability to encode images from URLs: maybe we upload to an anonymous image host (not ideal) or use base64 (if Notion supports). Alternatively, instruct user to copy/paste if needed. If Confluence, their API might allow attachments upload. So complexity revolves around file upload without our server. Perhaps we leverage GitHub Gist or data URI (Notion might not accept data URI for images). This needs careful approach to remain serverless. Maybe we push the burden: e.g. open a browser tab with all images and user saves them to Notion – not elegant. Perhaps limit MVP to generating text content with frame names and a link to Figma prototypes (which can be embedded by link in Notion), if file upload is a problem. In any case, core complexity is medium.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~7 days. Capturing frame as image: Figma plugin can export frames as data (via exportAsync to PNG). Then Notion API calls to create a page and upload images – Notion’s API requires authentication (user will provide a token or use an integration token). The plugin can make HTTP calls directly (should be possible). Confluence integration would be more complex and might need skipping or later addition. AI not needed; straightforward data formatting.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that automates pushing Figma frames into Notion pages (or Confluence, as a stretch). The user could select frames and the plugin will generate a Notion page with those design images and optionally some metadata (like frame name, last updated). It could also allow updating an existing Notion doc when the design updates by replacing the images. Essentially a bridge between Figma and documentation, zero server by leveraging Notion’s public API via client calls.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
