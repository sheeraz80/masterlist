# LayoutPlanner (Grid & Guide Assistant) - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 2/10 – Very straightforward to apply grid settings via API (just copying an array of grid definitions). Calculating positions to check alignment requires basic math mod operations. Drawing lines for guides is simple shape creation. This is mostly a UI/UX design problem to present options nicely, technically not complex.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~4 days. Figma’s API allows setting layoutGrid properties on frames (which define column grids). We can easily loop and apply. Drawing persistent guide lines might be trickier since Figma doesn’t have a guide concept in API, but we could create line objects on a separate locked layer as “guides.” Highlighting misaligned elements would require scanning positions relative to grid – doable.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that helps plan and apply grid systems and guides across multiple frames. The user can define a grid (say 12-column with 16px gutter, margin X) once and the plugin will apply corresponding layout grids to all selected frames or even draw guide lines. It can also detect elements that are off-grid and highlight them. This ensures pixel-perfect layout alignment throughout a project with minimal manual setup.
