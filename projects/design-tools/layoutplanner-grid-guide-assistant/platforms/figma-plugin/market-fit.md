# LayoutPlanner (Grid & Guide Assistant) - Figma Plugin Market Fit

## Platform Ecosystem Fit

### Target Market
Web and app designers dealing with column grids (especially those designing responsive web where they might simulate breakpoints in Figma), and anyone who cares about consistent spacing and alignment (designers moving from Sketch might miss some guide features). Design teams establishing a design system might also use it to enforce grid standards.

### Revenue Model
Mostly one-time or low-cost. This is a utility that appeals to precision-focused designers. A one-time $10 might be reasonable. Hard to make this subscription-worthy as it’s somewhat set-and-forget per project, unless we add more ongoing features like continuous off-grid monitoring. Possibly freeware with donation, but to meet the task requirement, let’s say one-time purchase.

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $100/month; Realistic: $500/month; Optimistic: $1,500/month. It’s a narrower audience (some designers are fine eyeballing or using built-in grids), but those who need it will appreciate it. Optimistic if it becomes standard for agency web designers. Might not be a huge money-maker but complements others.

### Platform-Specific Advantages
- Access to millions of Figma users
- Built-in distribution through Figma Community
- Direct integration with design workflows
- No need for separate user acquisition

### Monetization Strategy
Selling points: improved consistency, saved time (don’t manually set up each frame’s grid or worry about missing a column alignment). Market through web design communities and maybe mention on Figma support forums where people ask about guides. A short video showing how one button sets up all screens will attract intermediate/advanced designers. Price is low, so it might be an impulse buy for those frustrated with current approach. Possibly bundle it with other design tools if we had a suite.

### Distribution Strategy
- Primary: Platform-specific marketplace
- Secondary: Direct marketing to platform users
- Tertiary: Content marketing and community engagement

### Success Metrics
- Platform-specific installation metrics
- User engagement within platform context
- Revenue generated through platform channels
- User retention and satisfaction scores
