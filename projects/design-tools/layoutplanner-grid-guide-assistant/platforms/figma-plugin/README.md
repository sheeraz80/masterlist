# LayoutPlanner (Grid & Guide Assistant) - Figma Plugin

## Platform-Specific Implementation

### Overview
This implementation targets the **Figma Plugin** platform.

### Target Users
Web and app designers dealing with column grids (especially those designing responsive web where they might simulate breakpoints in Figma), and anyone who cares about consistent spacing and alignment (designers moving from Sketch might miss some guide features). Design teams establishing a design system might also use it to enforce grid standards.
