# Publish to Web Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Obsidian's official Publish service is excellent but can be expensive for users who just want to share a few notes publicly. Other methods require complex setups with Git and static site generators.

**Solution:** A simple plugin that allows users to publish selected notes to a public, shareable URL with one click, using a free hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify on the backend.

**Target Users:** Students sharing notes, bloggers, and anyone who wants a simple way to create a public digital garden.

## Quality Score

- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $4,000/mo; Optimistic: $12,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. This requires a serverless backend. The plugin would send the note's content to a serverless function, which then deploys it as a simple static page. The user would need to connect their own Vercel/Netlify account.

## Competition Level
Medium. The official Publish service is the main competitor. The value proposition here is affordability and simplicity for less demanding use cases.

## Key Features
- One-Click Publish: A button in the editor to instantly publish or update a note.
- Custom Domains (Pro): A premium feature to connect a custom domain to your published site.
- Password Protection (Pro): Protect specific notes with a simple password.
- Theming: Choose from several clean, readable themes for your public notes.
- Graph View Display: Option to embed an interactive graph of the published notes.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and the number of sites published with the service.

## Additional Information
