# SVG Animation Exporter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating simple UI animations (like hover states or loading spinners) and exporting them for web use can be complex. Tools like LottieFiles are powerful but can be overkill for simple animations, and exporting to GIF often results in large file sizes and poor quality.

**Solution:** A simplified plugin for creating basic frame-by-frame animations between component variants and exporting them as optimized, lightweight animated SVGs (using SMIL) or GIFs.

**Target Users:** UI designers and front-end developers who need simple, performant micro-interactions.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $1,800/mo; Optimistic: $4,500/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. The UI would allow a user to sequence component variants to create an animation timeline. The core technical challenge is building the exporter, which would need to generate the XML code for an animated SVG or use a client-side JavaScript library to compile a GIF.

## Competition Level
Medium. LottieFiles is the dominant player for complex animations. This tool would compete by being simpler, faster, and focused on a different output format (animated SVG) which is ideal for simple icons and loaders.

## Key Features
- Variant-Based Animation: Create animations by sequencing the variants of a component (e.g., button/default -> button/hover).
- Simple Timeline: A basic timeline UI to adjust the duration and easing between frames.
- Animated SVG Export: Export the animation as a single, lightweight .svg file using SMIL animations.
- Optimized GIF Export: An alternative export option to a color-optimized GIF.
- Live Preview: Preview the animation loop directly within the plugin.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume, and adoption by developers looking for a Lottie alternative for simple animations.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
