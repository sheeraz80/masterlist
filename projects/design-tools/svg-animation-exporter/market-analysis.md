# SVG Animation Exporter - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Creating simple UI animations (like hover states or loading spinners) and exporting them for web use can be complex. Tools like LottieFiles are powerful but can be overkill for simple animations, and exporting to GIF often results in large file sizes and poor quality.

### Target Market
UI designers and front-end developers who need simple, performant micro-interactions.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. LottieFiles is the dominant player for complex animations. This tool would compete by being simpler, faster, and focused on a different output format (animated SVG) which is ideal for simple icons and loaders.
