# AI-Enhanced Search

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Traditional search engines provide a list of links, requiring the user to click through multiple pages to synthesize an answer. This is inefficient for complex research questions.

**Solution:** A browser extension that enhances Google Search by adding an AI-powered sidebar. This sidebar reads the top search results and provides a direct, synthesized answer to the user's query, complete with citations from the source links.

**Target Users:** All internet users, especially researchers, students, and knowledge workers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.0/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 10/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 4/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Browser Tools](./platforms/ai-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $12,000/mo; Optimistic: $50,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension scrapes the URLs from the Google search results page. It then fetches the content from the top 3-5 links and sends this content, along with the original query, to an LLM API to generate a summary answer. This all happens client-side.

## Competition Level
High. Perplexity is a major player, and Google itself is integrating AI Overviews. The niche is to be a lightweight, privacy-focused enhancement to the existing Google experience, rather than a full replacement search engine.

## Key Features
- AI Answer Sidebar: An AI-generated answer appears next to the standard Google search results.
- Inline Citations: The AI answer includes numbered citations that link directly to the source articles.
- Follow-up Questions: A chat interface allows the user to ask follow-up questions about the search results.
- Privacy Focus: All processing is done on-demand, and no user search history is stored on the extension's servers.
- Video & News Modes (Pro): A premium feature to specifically summarize top video or news results.

## Success Indicators
MRR, Pro conversion rate, and daily active users.

## Additional Information
