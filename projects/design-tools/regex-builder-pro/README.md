# Regex Builder Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Writing and debugging regular expressions is a common but often frustrating task for developers. It usually involves trial and error and switching to an external web-based tool.

**Solution:** An integrated, interactive Regex editor within VSCode. It provides a UI to build a pattern, test it against sample text in real-time, and get a human-readable explanation of what the regex does.

**Target Users:** All developers who work with text processing and validation.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $2,200/mo; Optimistic: $6,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The core logic uses the native JavaScript regex engine. The main work is building a user-friendly webview UI with input fields for the pattern and test string, and a display area for matches and explanations.

## Competition Level
Medium. There are several existing regex extensions. The opportunity is to create a tool with a superior UI, real-time highlighting of matches in the editor, and a better explanation feature.

## Key Features
- Interactive Builder: Build regex patterns with a UI that helps with common tokens (e.g., \d, \w, ``).
- Real-Time Testing: See matches highlighted instantly in a test string panel as you type your pattern.
- Regex Explanations: Automatically generate a plain-English explanation of what your regex pattern does.
- Cheat Sheet: A built-in, searchable cheat sheet for common regex syntax.
- Code Snippet Generation: Generate code snippets for using the regex in various languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.).

## Success Indicators
Total sales and positive reviews praising its ease of use and workflow integration.
