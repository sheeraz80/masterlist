# Real Estate Deal Analyzer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Real estate investors need to quickly analyze potential rental properties or fix-and-flips. They often rely on complex, error-prone spreadsheets to calculate metrics like cash flow, cap rate, and cash-on-cash return.

**Solution:** A Notion template that provides a simple, clean interface for analyzing real estate deals. The user inputs key numbers (purchase price, rent, expenses), and the template automatically calculates all the critical investment metrics.

**Target Users:** Real estate investors, real estate agents, and anyone interested in buying investment properties.
