# Google Docs Style Manager

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Teams using Google Docs for documentation or proposals struggle to maintain consistent styling. Applying a specific set of heading, paragraph, and color styles across multiple documents is a manual and error-prone process.

**Solution:** An extension that adds a style management sidebar to Google Docs. Users can define a "Style Set" (fonts, sizes, colors for H1, H2, body, etc.) and then apply it to any document with one click.

**Target Users:** Marketing teams, consulting firms, students, and any team that produces branded documents in Google Docs.
