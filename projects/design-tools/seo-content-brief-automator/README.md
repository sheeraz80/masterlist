# SEO Content Brief Automator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating effective, SEO-optimized content requires a detailed brief that outlines the target keyword, competitors, required headings, and semantic keywords. Building these briefs manually involves hours of research and analysis across multiple tools.

**Solution:** An AI-powered browser tool that integrates with Jasper. The user provides a target keyword, and the tool scrapes the top 10 Google results, analyzes their content structure, and then uses Jasper to generate a comprehensive content brief inside a Jasper Doc.

**Target Users:** SEO specialists, content managers, and freelance writers.

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $1,000/mo; Realistic: $9,000/mo; Optimistic: $35,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. Requires a browser extension to trigger the workflow and a serverless function to handle the web scraping of Google search results. The scraped data is then fed into a complex Jasper prompt to generate the brief.

## Competition Level
High. This competes directly with established SEO content tools like Surfer SEO and Clearscope. The niche is to offer a more affordable, Jasper-integrated solution for users who don't need the full feature set of the expensive platforms.

## Key Features
- Automated SERP Analysis: Scrapes and analyzes the top-ranking content for any keyword.
- Content Structure Outline: Generates a recommended H1/H2/H3 structure based on what's already ranking.
- Semantic Keyword Suggestions: Identifies related terms and entities (LSI keywords) that should be included in the article.
- Word Count & Readability Targets: Provides recommended targets for content length and reading level.
- Jasper Doc Output: The final brief is generated as a clean, shareable document within the Jasper ecosystem.
