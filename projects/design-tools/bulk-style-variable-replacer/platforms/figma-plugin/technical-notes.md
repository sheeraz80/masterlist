# Bulk Style & Variable Replacer - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 5/10. This requires a deep traversal of the document tree. The logic must identify every layer property (fills, strokes, effects, fonts) that uses the target style and then re-assign it to the replacement style. Handling edge cases and ensuring performance on large files is the main challenge.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 4-5 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A simple utility that allows a user to select a "find" style/variable and a "replace" style/variable, then scans the entire document and replaces every instance of the former with the latter.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
