# Bulk Style & Variable Replacer - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
When refactoring a design system or merging two files, designers often need to replace all instances of one color/text style with another. Figma's native "Select all with..." feature can be cumbersome and doesn't work well for replacing a style with a completely different one across hundreds of frames.

### Target Market
Design system maintainers, designers working on large-scale redesigns, and anyone who needs to perform bulk style updates.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium. Plugins like Style Replacer exist, but there is room for a more robust tool that also handles variables, offers a better UI, and includes advanced features like a "dry run" preview.

- **Realistic:** 2,000/mo
- **Optimistic:** 5,500/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: Freemium model to encourage widespread adoption and demonstrate value before asking for payment. Tiers: Free: Replace up to 20 instances at a time. Pro ($5/month or $49/year): Unlimited replacements, "Dry Run" preview feature, and replacement history. Acquisition: Target users searching for "Figma replace style" or "Figma bulk update". Create short, effective demo videos for social media.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: A bug could cause irreversible changes to a user's file. A robust undo feature and extensive testing are critical. Performance on files with tens of thousands of layers could be a challenge. Platform Risk: Figma could improve its native style management tools at any time, potentially making this plugin redundant.
