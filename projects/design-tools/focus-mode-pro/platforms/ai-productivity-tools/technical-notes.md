# Focus Mode Pro - Ai Productivity Tools Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10. The plugin would create a large, semi-transparent rectangle layer that covers the entire viewport. It would then need to calculate the position and size of the selected frame(s) and create a "hole" in the overlay rectangle to reveal the focused content. The main challenge is managing the overlay layer effectively.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 3-4 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that provides a "Focus Mode" which temporarily dims the entire Figma canvas and UI except for the currently selected frame(s), creating a distraction-free "spotlight" on the work area.
