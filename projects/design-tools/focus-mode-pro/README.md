# Focus Mode Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Working on a specific component or section within a large, visually complex Figma file can be distracting. The surrounding UI and other artboards create visual noise that can break a designer's concentration.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a "Focus Mode" which temporarily dims the entire Figma canvas and UI except for the currently selected frame(s), creating a distraction-free "spotlight" on the work area.

**Target Users:** All Figma users, especially those who are easily distracted or work on visually dense pages.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.7/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Ai Productivity Tools](./platforms/ai-productivity-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/mo; Realistic: $1,500/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The plugin would create a large, semi-transparent rectangle layer that covers the entire viewport. It would then need to calculate the position and size of the selected frame(s) and create a "hole" in the overlay rectangle to reveal the focused content. The main challenge is managing the overlay layer effectively.

## Competition Level
Low. While some plugins offer Zen or distraction-free modes, a simple, elegant "spotlight" feature is not a common offering.

## Key Features
- Spotlight Effect: Dims the rest of the canvas to highlight the selected frame.
- UI Dimming: An option to also dim the Figma sidebars and toolbar for maximum focus.
- Customizable Overlay: Users can change the color and opacity of the dimming overlay.
- Ambient Sounds (Pro Feature): Integration of ambient background sounds (like rain or a coffee shop) to enhance focus, similar to the Soundscapes plugin.
- Pomodoro Timer (Pro Feature): A simple Pomodoro timer integrated into the focus mode UI to structure work sessions.
