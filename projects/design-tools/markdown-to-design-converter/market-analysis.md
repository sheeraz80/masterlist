# Markdown-to-Design Converter - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Content creators and developers often write content in Markdown. Getting this content into a styled Figma design requires a tedious manual process of copying text, creating individual text layers, and applying styles for headers, lists, and bold/italic text.

### Target Market
Content designers, UX writers, and developers who work with both Markdown and Figma.

## Competition Analysis
