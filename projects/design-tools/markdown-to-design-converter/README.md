# Markdown-to-Design Converter

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Content creators and developers often write content in Markdown. Getting this content into a styled Figma design requires a tedious manual process of copying text, creating individual text layers, and applying styles for headers, lists, and bold/italic text.

**Solution:** A plugin that takes raw Markdown text as input and automatically generates a structured and styled set of Figma layers, correctly applying local text styles for headings (H1, H2), paragraphs, lists, etc.

**Target Users:** Content designers, UX writers, and developers who work with both Markdown and Figma.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.7/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 4/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $300/mo; Realistic: $1,200/mo; Optimistic: $3,500/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The core of the plugin is a client-side JavaScript library for parsing Markdown (like ). The plugin's logic would then traverse the parsed structure and create corresponding Figma text nodes, applying Figma text styles that the user maps to Markdown elements (e.g., map "H1" to the "Heading 1" style).

## Competition Level
Low. While some tools convert HTML to Figma, a direct Markdown-to-Figma workflow is a less-served but common need, especially for documentation and blog design.

## Key Features
- Markdown Input: A simple text area to paste Markdown content.
- Style Mapping: A settings panel where users can map Markdown elements (h1, h2, p, ul, etc.) to their local Figma text styles.
- Auto Layout Generation: Automatically creates a vertical Auto Layout frame to contain the generated text layers, ensuring proper spacing.
- Image Support: Recognizes Markdown image syntax and imports the images into the design.
- Code Block Styling: Correctly formats code blocks, ideally with syntax highlighting applied as a rasterized image from a library like .

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and user reviews highlighting workflow speed improvements for content-heavy design projects.

## Additional Information
