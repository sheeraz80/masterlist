# Investment Portfolio Tracker

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Investors often have their assets (stocks, crypto, real estate) spread across multiple platforms and accounts. Getting a single, unified view of their entire net worth and portfolio performance is difficult and requires manual updates in a spreadsheet.

**Solution:** A comprehensive Notion template for tracking a diverse investment portfolio. It includes databases for different asset classes and a master dashboard that rolls up all the data to show total net worth and performance over time.

**Target Users:** Retail investors, personal finance enthusiasts, and individuals tracking their path to financial independence (FIRE).
