# Smart Contract Reader

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Interacting with a smart contract requires trusting its code, but the vast majority of users cannot read Solidity or understand the bytecode shown on block explorers. This information asymmetry creates significant risk.

**Solution:** An AI-powered extension that adds a "Summarize in Plain English" button to smart contract pages on Etherscan. The AI reads the verified source code and provides a simple summary of the contract's main functions and potential risks.

**Target Users:** All crypto users, especially those exploring new or unaudited projects.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $9,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. The extension scrapes the verified source code from a block explorer page. This code is then sent to an LLM API (like GPT-4o or Claude) with a prompt like, "Analyze this Solidity smart contract. Summarize its key functions and identify any potentially risky functions, such as those that allow the owner to drain funds or freeze transfers."

## Competition Level
Low. This is a novel application of AI to solve a major security and usability problem in crypto.

## Key Features
- AI-Powered Code Summary: Provides a high-level overview of what a smart contract does.
- Risk Function Highlighting: Specifically flags functions that could be malicious or centralize power (e.g., selfdestruct, delegatecall to an arbitrary address).
- Tokenomics Analysis: If it's a token contract, it summarizes key parameters like total supply and transfer tax.
- Comparison to Standards: Checks if the contract adheres to common standards like ERC-20 or ERC-721.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales and user testimonials about avoiding risky contracts.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
