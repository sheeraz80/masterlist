# Version Snapshotter - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** The "diffing" algorithm is the core of the product and is very difficult to get right, especially for complex, nested frames. This is a significant technical risk. Market Risk: The need might be perceived as a "nice-to-have," but for agencies, clear communication is a billable efficiency.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that takes two versions of a frame (e.g., the current version and a version from yesterday) and generates a new "diff" frame that visually highlights the changes: elements that were added, removed, or modified.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints

- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
