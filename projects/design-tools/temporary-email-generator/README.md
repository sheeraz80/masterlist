# Temporary Email Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users often need to sign up for services or download content that requires an email address, but they don't want to give out their primary email and risk receiving spam.

**Solution:** An extension that, with one click, generates a temporary, disposable email address and opens the inbox for that address in a new tab. The address is fully functional for receiving confirmation emails.

**Target Users:** Privacy-conscious users, developers testing sign-up flows, and anyone who wants to avoid spam.
