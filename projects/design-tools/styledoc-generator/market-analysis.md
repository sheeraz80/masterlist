# StyleDoc Generator - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
When handing off to developers or documenting a design system, designers spend time creating style guides manually – listing colors, fonts, spacings, etc. It’s repetitive to extract this info from Figma and format it into documentation or slides. A lot of teams want an up-to-date style guide but don’t have a quick automated way from Figma.

### Target Market
Design system maintainers, and any designers or front-end developers who want an easy way to see all styles used in a design. This spans freelancers (delivering a style guide to clients) to internal teams prepping for development handoff.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Medium – There’s at least one known plugin, “Stylify” or “Design System Documenter,” and some internal tools that generate style pages. However, none have cornered the market, possibly due to output format issues. There’s also Figma’s own “Tokens” plugin but that’s more for JSON export. Our competition is those existing attempts and the alternative of doing it by hand. With superior usability and formatting, we can compete.

## Revenue Analysis

### Revenue Model
One-time purchase (e.g. $15) or a slightly higher one-time ($25) given it’s a deliverable generator. Alternatively, freemium: free does basic colors and fonts, Pro does components and advanced layout. But one-time could suffice as the value is delivered mainly at certain milestones (not daily use).

### Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/month; Realistic: $1,200/month; Optimistic: $4,000/month. Many in the community ask for easier style documentation – a solid tool could sell well, especially if showcased on Product Hunt or similar. The optimistic case would require it becoming a go-to for agencies handing off style guides regularly.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 400/month
- **Realistic:** 1,200/month
- **Optimistic:** 4,000/month

### Monetization Strategy
Pitch this as saving hours of grunt work and ensuring nothing is missed in documentation. Great for agencies – they can justify the cost easily per project. Distribute on Figma Community (where people search for style guide solutions) and on dev forums (front-end devs might nudge designers to use it for clarity). We could also gather email list of buyers to upsell future related tools (maybe out of scope now, but a thought). Since others have free plugins, our success will depend on quality of output – so showing comparison (ours produces a polished guide in 5 minutes vs spending an afternoon manually) is key for convincing.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Quality risk: If the automatically generated layout is ugly or requires a lot of tweaking, users won’t find it valuable. We mitigate by carefully designing the template for output and maybe offering minor customization (like light vs dark background for the style page, or including/excluding certain categories). Competition: Free alternatives could undercut us, but if they’re not well-maintained or missing features (like component previews), we emphasize our completeness and support. Platform: Very low risk; using official APIs. Possibly if Figma allowed built-in style export in future, but no sign yet. Market: Some teams using tools like ZeroHeight or Storybook might not need this, but that’s fine – we target those not investing in bigger tools.

### Key Risks
- Platform dependency risk
- Competition risk
- Technical implementation risk
- Market adoption risk
- Revenue sustainability risk

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify across multiple platforms
- Focus on unique value proposition
- Maintain technical excellence
- Build strong user community
- Develop sustainable revenue streams

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Platform user base size
- Market segment size
- Growth potential

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- Targetable user subset
- Geographic limitations
- Platform-specific constraints

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- Realistic market capture
- Competitive positioning
- Resource limitations

## Success Indicators
Number of style guides generated (especially if users come back to update them, indicates ongoing utility); anecdotal evidence like posts or tweets praising how quick it was; sales and maybe presence in “popular plugins” if Figma highlights it. Also, reduced manual documentation time as reported by users (e.g. “saved me half a day”).
