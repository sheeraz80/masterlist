# StyleDoc Generator - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10 – Creating Figma nodes via plugin is straightforward. The complexity is in deciding how to display components (maybe snapshot each component as an icon, which might be tricky without an API to render – but we can instantiate each component master on the doc page as an instance to show it). Also if there are many styles, making it nicely paginated or scrollable is something to design carefully. Still, it’s manageable with static rules (e.g. 4 columns of color swatches, etc.).

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. Retrieving all shared styles (color, text, effect) is easy via API, likewise listing components. The challenge is laying them out nicely on a page. We can programmatically create frames and text in Figma for the documentation. AI not needed except maybe to choose layout or group intelligently (not crucial).

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that generates a style guide document (inside Figma or as an exportable file) from the design file’s styles and components. It would create a new page summarizing text styles (with examples), color palette (swatches with names and values), and possibly a table of components with previews. Essentially, one click to get a “Design System Overview” page. This can be printed to PDF or shared with devs for quick reference.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
