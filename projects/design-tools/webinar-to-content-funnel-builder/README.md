# Webinar to Content Funnel Builder

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Webinars are a great source of high-quality content, but marketers often fail to fully capitalize on them. Repurposing a one-hour webinar into a cohesive set of marketing assets for a follow-up campaign requires significant manual effort.

**Solution:** An AI-powered workflow that takes a webinar transcript and generates an entire content marketing funnel: a summary blog post, a 3-part email nurture sequence, and 5 social media posts to promote the content.

**Target Users:** B2B marketers, demand generation specialists, and content marketing teams.

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $6,000/mo; Optimistic: $20,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. This is a complex chain of Jasper prompts. The AI first summarizes the webinar, then uses that summary to create a blog post, then uses the blog post to create the emails, and finally uses the key points to create the social media posts, ensuring consistency throughout the funnel.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a highly specific, multi-output workflow that goes beyond what most generic AI writers can do in a single step.

## Key Features
- Full Funnel Generation: Creates five distinct types of content assets from a single transcript.
- Cohesive Messaging: Ensures the messaging and key points are consistent across the blog post, emails, and social media.
- Customizable Tone: Allows the user to set the tone for the entire funnel (e.g., educational, promotional).
- Action-Oriented Copy: The emails and social posts are written with clear calls-to-action to drive engagement.
- Jasper Canvas Output: The entire funnel is laid out visually on a Jasper Canvas for easy review and editing.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of active subscribers, and case studies showing increased post-webinar engagement.
