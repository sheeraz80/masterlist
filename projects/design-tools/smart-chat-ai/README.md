# Smart Chat (AI)

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users want to "talk" to their notes, asking questions and getting synthesized answers from their knowledge base. Existing AI plugins can be clunky or require sending large amounts of data to external services.

**Solution:** An AI chat plugin that uses a local-first approach. It creates a local vector index of the vault and uses a small, local LLM to answer questions based only on the content of the user's notes, ensuring 100% privacy.

**Target Users:** All Obsidian users, especially those with privacy concerns about cloud-based AI.

## Quality Score

- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $4,500/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
Bundling and running an LLM locally within a plugin is a major technical challenge and may have high performance overhead.

## Competition Level
Medium. Ollama Chat and other plugins are exploring this space. The unique value is a super-simple, one-click setup for a completely private, local-first chat experience.

## Key Features
- Local-First AI: All data and AI processing happen on the user's machine. Nothing is sent to the cloud.
- Chat with Your Vault: A sidebar chat interface where you can ask questions and get answers synthesized from your notes.
- Source Linking: Every answer includes links to the source notes it used to generate the response.
- Automatic Indexing: The plugin automatically keeps the search index up-to-date as you add or edit notes.
- Cloud AI Fallback (Pro): A premium option to use a more powerful cloud-based AI (like GPT-4) for more complex questions, for users who are comfortable with it.

## Success Indicators
MRR, Pro subscriber count, and praise for its privacy-first approach.

## Additional Information
