# Dev Handoff Optimizer - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 4/10 – Listing and checking layers is fine. Possibly the trickiest part is if we try to do a zip file of exports – Figma plugin can save files to the user’s computer via the UI (like trigger a download), but bundling might require base64 and link. We might skip automated bundling if too hard and just highlight to user what to export. If we attempt it: export images as bytes, then maybe use a JS zip library in plugin to create a zip blob and offer link to download – might be feasible. That would raise complexity but doable in JS.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~5 days. Checks are straightforward: find all image layers (or components with raster content) and see if marked for export – if not, list them. Check text layers to see if they use a text style – if some are manually overridden, flag them (so design system tokens aren’t broken). Collate color styles usage – maybe produce a list of all colors in use that aren’t in the official palette. These are all doable with the API. Packaging assets might mean triggering the built-in export for all marked layers and maybe zipping them – but without a server, maybe just instructing user to bulk export via Figma’s interface (the plugin can multi-select and export to local?). Might not handle zipping easily without a backend, but we can at least mark or highlight. Annotations could be just adding callout shapes or using comments (Figma comment via API not open to plugins I think). Possibly just highlight where designers should manually annotate. So mainly scanning and reporting.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
A plugin that checks a Figma file for common handoff readiness issues and assists in packaging assets. For example, it can ensure all icons/images intended for export are marked exportable at the right resolutions, all text styles and color styles are properly used (so devs can reference design tokens easily), and generate a quick summary of the spacing and dimensions of key elements. It might also allow adding annotations (like tooltips) that devs can read in the prototype. Essentially a “pre-flight” for design handoff.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
