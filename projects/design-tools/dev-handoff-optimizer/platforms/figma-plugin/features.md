# Dev Handoff Optimizer - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Exportables check: Identify all raster images (or vector icons) that likely need to be delivered (e.g. company logos, photos) and see if they have export settings (PNG/SVG). Flag any that are missing or if multiple scales needed (e.g. iOS @2x, @3x) and not set. Possibly provide a one-click to add standard export presets to those layers.
- Style consistency: List text that isn’t using a predefined text style (suggest to create one or use one) and colors not from color styles, because developers prefer consistent tokens.
- Spacing tokens: If the design system uses consistent spacings (like 8px increments), we can scan distances between elements – flag any odd spacing that’s off-grid (like 17px gap instead of 16px, which might be a mistake). This helps avoid weird values in code.
- Asset package (Pro): Let user select all export-marked assets and click “Export All Assets” to get a zip of them at correct resolutions naming appropriately (maybe pulling layer names). This saves time clicking each or using Figma’s export interface for multiple selections.
- Handoff summary: Generate a brief document (maybe markdown or a panel) listing key design tokens: e.g. color styles with their hex, text styles with font/size, spacing scale used, etc., and listing any flagged inconsistencies. This summary can be copied to share with devs or archived.
