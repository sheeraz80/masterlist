# Dev Handoff Optimizer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** When handing off designs to developers, a lot of time is spent clarifying measurements, assets, and intended behaviors. Figma provides some info in inspect mode, but designers often still create custom notes or ensure certain layers are marked for export. Mistakes or omissions in handoff can cause development rework. There’s an opportunity to streamline the handoff prep.

**Solution:** A plugin that checks a Figma file for common handoff readiness issues and assists in packaging assets. For example, it can ensure all icons/images intended for export are marked exportable at the right resolutions, all text styles and color styles are properly used (so devs can reference design tokens easily), and generate a quick summary of the spacing and dimensions of key elements. It might also allow adding annotations (like tooltips) that devs can read in the prototype. Essentially a “pre-flight” for design handoff.

**Target Users:** UI designers and design teams collaborating closely with developers – especially those not using an external handoff tool like Zeplin or when working with devs directly in Figma. Designers who want to minimize back-and-forth questions during implementation will appreciate this.

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Likely one-time or team license. Could be part of an internal toolkit purchase by a company. For an individual, maybe $15 one-time. If we position it as saving developer time, companies might pay. Possibly a small subscription for updates if it evolves, but one-time might lower friction for adoption.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $200/month; Realistic: $800/month; Optimistic: $2,000/month. Handoff is a universal need, but some might rely on built-in Figma inspect or other tools. If we make a compelling case that this prevents costly errors, teams (especially agencies) might adopt it broadly. The optimistic scenario would require strong word-of-mouth that it’s a must-do step.

## Development Time
~5 days. Checks are straightforward: find all image layers (or components with raster content) and see if marked for export – if not, list them. Check text layers to see if they use a text style – if some are manually overridden, flag them (so design system tokens aren’t broken). Collate color styles usage – maybe produce a list of all colors in use that aren’t in the official palette. These are all doable with the API. Packaging assets might mean triggering the built-in export for all marked layers and maybe zipping them – but without a server, maybe just instructing user to bulk export via Figma’s interface (the plugin can multi-select and export to local?). Might not handle zipping easily without a backend, but we can at least mark or highlight. Annotations could be just adding callout shapes or using comments (Figma comment via API not open to plugins I think). Possibly just highlight where designers should manually annotate. So mainly scanning and reporting.

## Technical Complexity
4/10 – Listing and checking layers is fine. Possibly the trickiest part is if we try to do a zip file of exports – Figma plugin can save files to the user’s computer via the UI (like trigger a download), but bundling might require base64 and link. We might skip automated bundling if too hard and just highlight to user what to export. If we attempt it: export images as bytes, then maybe use a JS zip library in plugin to create a zip blob and offer link to download – might be feasible. That would raise complexity but doable in JS.

## Competition Level
Low – Some teams use Zeplin or Storybook for organized handoff. But within Figma, not aware of a plugin that preflights. It’s a bit like part design-lint and part export manager. We might overlap with some design lint aspects (like the style usage check). But focusing on dev handoff context is unique.

## Key Features
- Exportables check: Identify all raster images (or vector icons) that likely need to be delivered (e.g. company logos, photos) and see if they have export settings (PNG/SVG). Flag any that are missing or if multiple scales needed (e.g. iOS @2x, @3x) and not set. Possibly provide a one-click to add standard export presets to those layers.
- Style consistency: List text that isn’t using a predefined text style (suggest to create one or use one) and colors not from color styles, because developers prefer consistent tokens.
- Spacing tokens: If the design system uses consistent spacings (like 8px increments), we can scan distances between elements – flag any odd spacing that’s off-grid (like 17px gap instead of 16px, which might be a mistake). This helps avoid weird values in code.
- Asset package (Pro): Let user select all export-marked assets and click “Export All Assets” to get a zip of them at correct resolutions naming appropriately (maybe pulling layer names). This saves time clicking each or using Figma’s export interface for multiple selections.
- Handoff summary: Generate a brief document (maybe markdown or a panel) listing key design tokens: e.g. color styles with their hex, text styles with font/size, spacing scale used, etc., and listing any flagged inconsistencies. This summary can be copied to share with devs or archived.

## Success Indicators
Reduction in post-handoff clarifications (hard to measure, but maybe user feedback states “devs asked fewer questions” or “no missing asset complaints this time”). The number of assets exported via the plugin or issues flagged could be tracked to show usage. If we get positive testimonials from a dev perspective (“I could implement the front-end faster because everything was ready”), that’s gold. And obviously, sales or adoption in companies (maybe multiple designers at same org using it) would show it’s valued.
