# AI Prompt Library & Manager

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Power users of AI tools like ChatGPT or Midjourney create and use hundreds of complex prompts. Storing these prompts in a simple text file or note is disorganized and makes it difficult to find, reuse, and share them with a team.

**Solution:** A Notion database template designed to be the ultimate library for AI prompts. It allows users to store, categorize, and quickly copy prompts, complete with fields for parameters, variables, and example outputs.

**Target Users:** AI power users, marketers, content creators, and developers.

## Technical Complexity
2/10. A simple but well-designed database is all that is required.

## Competition Level
Low. This is a niche but growing need. While some AI tools have their own library features, a centralized, tool-agnostic library in Notion is a powerful concept.
