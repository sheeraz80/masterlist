# Screenshot to Code (AI) - Chrome Extension Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 7/10. This is technically challenging. It requires using the .captureVisibleTab API to take a screenshot. The image data is then sent to a multimodal AI API (like GPT-4o or Claude) that can interpret images and generate code. The prompt engineering to get clean, usable code is critical. The user provides their own API key.

## Development Time
**Estimated:** 6-7 days.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An AI-powered extension that allows a user to take a screenshot of a portion of a webpage, sends the image to an AI vision model, and returns generated HTML and CSS (or Tailwind/React) code that approximates the design.
