# Screenshot to Code (AI)

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Front-end developers often see a component or layout on a website and want to quickly replicate the basic structure and styling in HTML and CSS without having to manually inspect and rewrite everything.

**Solution:** An AI-powered extension that allows a user to take a screenshot of a portion of a webpage, sends the image to an AI vision model, and returns generated HTML and CSS (or Tailwind/React) code that approximates the design.

**Target Users:** Front-end developers, UI/UX designers, and students learning web development.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.1/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 4/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Pay-per-use (Credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $18,000/mo.

## Development Time
6-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
7/10. This is technically challenging. It requires using the .captureVisibleTab API to take a screenshot. The image data is then sent to a multimodal AI API (like GPT-4o or Claude) that can interpret images and generate code. The prompt engineering to get clean, usable code is critical. The user provides their own API key.

## Competition Level
Low to Medium. This is an emerging category of AI tools. While some web apps do this, a browser extension that integrates this into the development workflow is a strong value proposition.

## Key Features
- Screenshot Capture: A simple tool to select an area of the screen to capture.
- AI Code Generation: Sends the image to an AI model and displays the generated code.
- Framework Selection: Users can choose the output format: plain HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, or React components.
- Code Editor UI: Displays the generated code with syntax highlighting and a one-click copy button.
- Iterative Refinement: A chat interface to ask the AI for modifications to the generated code (e.g., "make the button blue").

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit sales, quality of generated code, and adoption by developers for rapid prototyping.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
