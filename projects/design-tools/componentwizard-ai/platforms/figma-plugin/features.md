# ComponentWizard AI - Figma Plugin Features

## Core Features
- Similarity scan: Scans frames to list groups/layers that look alike (e.g. 10 identical buttons that aren’t linked as one component)
- One-click componentization: Automatically create a Figma component from a selection of similar elements, or replace all with an existing component
- Variant suggestion: If similar elements only differ by text or color, suggest making them variants of a component
- Ignore list: Ability to ignore certain suggestions or mark certain differences as intentional
- Report: Summary of how many potential components were found and how much repetition was reduced (e.g. “20 instances consolidated into 1 component”)
