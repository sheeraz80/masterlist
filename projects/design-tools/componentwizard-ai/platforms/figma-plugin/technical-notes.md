# ComponentWizard AI - Figma Plugin Technical Notes

## Technical Complexity
**Rating:** 6/10 – The toughest part is devising a reliable method to identify “similar” elements. Could start with rule-based checks (same size, style, content structure) and later integrate an AI model for better accuracy. Figma API allows creating and swapping components easily, so the main complexity is the algorithm. No server needed; computation can happen in-plugin (possibly leveraging or a small ML model in the browser).

## Development Time
**Estimated:** ~6 days. Implementing similarity detection using simple heuristics (layer structure, naming) or embedding via an AI model (could use local ML or small cloud call if needed) and integrating with Figma’s component creation API. AI assistance accelerates pattern recognition logic development.

## Platform-Specific Technical Details
An AI-assisted plugin that analyzes your Figma file to find layers or groups that are similar and suggests converting them into a single reusable component or using an existing component. It’s like a “spellcheck” but for component reuse, improving consistency and efficiency.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Constraints
- Must use Figma Plugin API
- Limited to Figma runtime environment
- No direct file system access
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Platform Opportunities
- Rich ecosystem integration
- Large user base
- Established distribution channels
- Platform-specific APIs and capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow platform best practices
- Optimize for platform performance
- Ensure compatibility with platform updates
- Implement proper error handling
