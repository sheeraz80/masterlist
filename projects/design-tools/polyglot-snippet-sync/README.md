# Polyglot Snippet Sync

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Developers who work across multiple machines struggle to keep their custom code snippets in sync. VSCode's built-in Settings Sync can handle this, but it's tied to a Microsoft/GitHub account and isn't easily shareable with a team.

**Solution:** A snippet manager that syncs snippets to a user-provided Git repository (e.g., a private GitHub repo). This gives the user full control over their data and allows for easy sharing with a team.

**Target Users:** Developers who work on multiple computers or as part of a team.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $5,500/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
5/10. Requires using a client-side Git implementation in JavaScript or shelling out to the system's Git command. The extension would need a UI to manage snippets and configure the remote repository.

## Competition Level
Medium. VSCode's native Settings Sync is the main competitor. The unique value is the Git-based backend, which offers more control, versioning, and team-sharing capabilities.

## Key Features
- Snippet Manager UI: A dedicated panel to create, edit, and organize snippets.
- Git-Based Sync: Syncs the snippet library to a private Git repository.
- Team Sharing (Pro): Allow multiple users to sync to the same repository, creating a shared team snippet library.
- Automatic Sync: Automatically pulls and pushes changes at regular intervals.
- Gist Integration: Option to sync snippets to GitHub Gists instead of a full repository.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of Pro subscribers, and adoption by development teams.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
