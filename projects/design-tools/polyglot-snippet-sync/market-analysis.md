# Polyglot Snippet Sync - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
Developers who work across multiple machines struggle to keep their custom code snippets in sync. VSCode's built-in Settings Sync can handle this, but it's tied to a Microsoft/GitHub account and isn't easily shareable with a team.

### Target Market
Developers who work on multiple computers or as part of a team.

## Competition Analysis
