# Dynamic Persona Generator

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Creating user personas for design projects is crucial but can be a chore. Designers often resort to using generic, uninspired placeholder data and stock photos, which fails to bring the persona to life for stakeholders.

**Solution:** A plugin that uses AI to generate rich, detailed, and demographically-consistent user personas with one click, complete with names, bios, goals, frustrations, and an AI-generated avatar.

**Target Users:** UX designers, user researchers, product managers, and marketing teams.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Figma Plugin](./platforms/figma-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium / Pay-per-use (credit system).

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,500/mo; Optimistic: $6,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The plugin would call two external APIs: an AI text generation API (like a free-tier OpenAI model) with a carefully crafted prompt to generate the persona data in JSON format, and an AI avatar generation API (like or a dedicated service). The user provides their own API keys.

## Competition Level
Medium. Plugins like UI Faces and User Profile | Avatar provide avatars, but not the rich, structured persona data. This tool combines avatar generation with AI-driven content generation.

## Key Features
- One-Click Generation: A single button to generate a complete persona.
- Custom Constraints: Simple inputs to guide the generation, such as "Age range: 25-35", "Industry: Tech", "Key characteristic: Busy parent".
- Persona Component: Generates a pre-styled Figma component containing the avatar and all the text fields, ready to be used in a presentation.
- Multiple Avatar Styles: Option to choose between photorealistic, illustrated, or abstract avatar styles.
- Regenerate Sections: Ability to re-generate just the bio or just the avatar without changing the rest of the persona.

## Success Indicators
Revenue from credit pack sales, number of personas generated, and user shares of their generated personas on social media.

## Additional Information
