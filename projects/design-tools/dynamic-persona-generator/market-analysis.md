### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A credit-based system. Users get a small number of free generations, then purchase credits for more. This avoids the complexity of a subscription for a tool that may be used intermittently. Pricing: Free: 5 free persona generations. Credit Packs: $10 for 50 generations, $25 for 200 generations. Acquisition: Promote in UX research and product management communities. Create a gallery of beautifully generated personas. Offer a free "Persona Generator" web app as a lead magnet to the plugin.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
API Costs: The cost of the AI APIs could be significant if not managed properly. The pay-per-use model directly ties revenue to this cost, mitigating risk. AI Quality: The quality and consistency of the AI-generated content can vary. Prompt engineering is key to ensuring useful and non-generic outputs.
