# NFT Minting Assistant

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Participating in popular NFT mints is a competitive and often confusing process. Users need to know the exact contract address, the minting function name, and the correct price, and they need to act fast.

**Solution:** A browser extension that helps users prepare for and execute NFT mints. It allows users to pre-load the contract address and minting parameters, and provides a "quick mint" button that calls the contract function directly, bypassing potentially slow or crashed minting websites.

**Target Users:** NFT traders and collectors, "degen" minters.

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $15,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is an advanced tool. It requires a deep understanding of how to interact with smart contracts via or. The UI would allow a user to input the contract ABI and function details, and the extension would construct and send the transaction to the user's wallet for signing.

## Competition Level
Medium. This functionality is often part of more complex, expensive "alpha" bots. A simple, user-friendly tool for this specific purpose has a clear market.

## Key Features
- Mint Profile Setup: A UI to save mint details (contract address, function name, price) ahead of time.
- Quick Mint Button: A button that can be clicked to immediately send the pre-configured mint transaction to the user's wallet.
- Gas Preset: Allows users to set a custom gas fee to increase the chance of their transaction succeeding in a "gas war."
- Multi-Wallet Support: Quickly switch between different wallets for minting.
- Safety Checks: The tool simulates the transaction to ensure it's not calling a malicious function.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and user reports of successful mints using the tool.
