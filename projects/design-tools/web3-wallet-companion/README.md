# Web3 Wallet Companion

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While wallets like MetaMask are powerful, their UI can be confusing for beginners. Common tasks like adding a new network, importing a custom token, or finding a transaction in a block explorer are not always intuitive.

**Solution:** A companion extension that works alongside a user's primary wallet. It provides a simplified interface and guided workflows for common tasks, acting as a user-friendly "skin" for their existing wallet.

**Target Users:** New crypto users, and those who find existing wallet UIs to be too complex.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $5,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The extension would not handle private keys. It would interact with the existing wallet's injected provider (e.g., ) to request actions like adding a network or signing a transaction, but would present these actions in a much simpler UI.

## Competition Level
Medium. Wallets themselves are constantly trying to improve their UI. The niche is to be a third-party "helper" that simplifies the experience across multiple wallets.

## Key Features
- Guided Network Adder: A simple wizard to add popular EVM networks with one click.
- Simplified Token Importer: Paste a contract address and the extension automatically finds the token's symbol and decimals and prompts the wallet to add it.
- Human-Readable Transaction History: Displays a simplified transaction history, translating cryptic function calls into plain English (e.g., "Swapped ETH for USDC on Uniswap").
- Educational Tooltips: Provides helpful explanations for crypto jargon throughout the UI.

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and positive reviews from new users who found crypto easier to navigate with the tool.
