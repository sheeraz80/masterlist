# Typewriter Focus Mode

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Writers often seek a minimalist, distraction-free writing environment. While some plugins offer typewriter scrolling, they don't fully replicate the focused experience of dedicated writing apps like iA Writer or Ulysses.

**Solution:** A plugin that provides a highly polished and customizable "Focus Mode." It centers the current line, fades out surrounding text, hides all UI elements, and can even play subtle typewriter sounds.

**Target Users:** Writers, bloggers, journalists, and anyone who does long-form writing in Obsidian.
