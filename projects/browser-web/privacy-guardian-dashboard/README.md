# Privacy Guardian Dashboard

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Users are increasingly concerned about online tracking but lack a simple way to visualize and control the trackers, cookies, and fingerprinting scripts active on the websites they visit. Standard ad-blockers work in the background but don't provide accessible insights.

**Solution:** A user-friendly dashboard that provides a real-time "privacy score" for the current website, visualizes all trackers and cookies, and gives the user granular control to block specific elements.

**Target Users:** Privacy-conscious individuals, journalists, activists, and anyone wanting more control over their digital footprint.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.5/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 4/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Subscription.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $800/mo; Realistic: $6,000/mo; Optimistic: $20,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-7 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. Uses the API to intercept and block network requests based on known tracker lists (e.g., EasyList, EasyPrivacy). The main complexity is in building the dashboard UI and the logic for calculating a "privacy score."

## Competition Level
High. Extensions like Ghostery are very popular. The niche is to focus on the dashboard and visualization aspect, making privacy understandable for a less technical audience, rather than just being a blocker.

## Key Features
- Privacy Score: An easy-to-understand score (A-F) for each website based on the number and type of trackers detected.
- Tracker Visualization: A visual graph showing which third-party domains are being contacted by the current page.
- Granular Control: Allow users to block or allow specific scripts or cookies on a per-site basis.
- Fingerprinting Protection: Actively blocks or randomizes browser fingerprinting techniques.
- Privacy Report: A weekly report summarizing the trackers blocked and the most and least private sites visited.

## Success Indicators
MRR, number of premium subscribers, and positive reviews highlighting the clarity of the privacy dashboard.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
