## Competition Analysis

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A subscription model is suitable for an ongoing service like privacy protection. Pricing: Premium ($4/month or $39/year) for advanced features like historical reporting, custom blocklists, and enhanced fingerprinting protection. The core tracker blocking and dashboard are free. Acquisition: Target privacy-focused communities like /r/privacy. Write educational content about online tracking and browser fingerprinting.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: Maintaining and updating tracker blocklists is an ongoing effort. A bug in the blocking engine could break website functionality, leading to user frustration.
