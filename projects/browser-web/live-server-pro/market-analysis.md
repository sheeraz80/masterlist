Strategy: Freemium. The core local server is free. The public sharing features are part of a Pro subscription. Pricing: Pro Plan ($6/month) for all sharing features. Acquisition: Target the massive user base of the existing Live Server extension. Create tutorials on "how to easily share your local website with clients."

### Overall Risk
Dependency Risk: Relies on a third-party tunneling service like ngrok. If their service has issues or changes terms, the Pro features are affected. Security Risk: Exposing a local server to the internet carries inherent risks. The extension must clearly warn users about this.
