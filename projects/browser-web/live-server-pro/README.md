# Live Server Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Live Server is one of the most popular extensions for front-end development, providing a simple local server with live reload. However, it lacks features for testing on multiple devices or sharing a temporary live URL with colleagues or clients.

**Solution:** A "Pro" version of Live Server that uses a tunneling service (like ngrok) to create a temporary, public URL for your local development server, allowing others to view your work in real-time from any device.

**Target Users:** Front-end developers, web designers, and freelancers who need to share work-in-progress with clients.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.7/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 8/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 6/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 4/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Vscode Extension](./platforms/vscode-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Freemium.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $700/mo; Realistic: $5,000/mo; Optimistic: $18,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
5/10. The extension would still use the core logic of Live Server but would also programmatically start and manage an ngrok (or similar) tunnel. This might require bundling the ngrok binary or using a JavaScript-based alternative.

## Competition Level
High. The original Live Server is free and has millions of users. Some developers are familiar with using ngrok from the command line. The value is in the seamless, one-click integration.

## Key Features
- Local Dev Server with Live Reload: The core feature of the original extension.
- One-Click Public URL (Pro): A button in the status bar to generate a temporary public URL for your local server.
- QR Code for Mobile Testing (Pro): Displays a QR code of the public URL, making it easy to open on a mobile device for testing.
- Password Protection (Pro): Option to add basic password protection to the public URL.
- Custom Subdomains (Pro): Allow users to specify a custom subdomain for their public URL.

## Success Indicators
MRR, Pro subscriber count, and testimonials from freelancers about improved client feedback cycles.

## Additional Information
