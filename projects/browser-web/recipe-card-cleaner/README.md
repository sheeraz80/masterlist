# Recipe Card Cleaner

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Online recipe sites are notoriously cluttered with long personal stories, ads, and pop-ups, making it difficult to get to the actual recipe instructions.

**Solution:** A one-click extension that scans a recipe page, extracts the core ingredients and instructions, and displays them in a clean, standardized, and printable "recipe card" format.

**Target Users:** Home cooks, bakers, and anyone who uses online recipes.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

### Score Breakdown

- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $400/mo; Realistic: $2,000/mo; Optimistic: $6,000/mo.

## Development Time
5-6 days.

## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is a specialized web scraping problem. The extension needs to be trained to recognize the common HTML structures (using /Recipe microdata where available) that contain ingredients and instructions across a wide variety of food blogs and recipe sites.
