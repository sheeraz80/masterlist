# YouTube Ad-Free Experience Enhancer

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While ad-blockers can remove video ads on YouTube, they don't remove in-video sponsor segments, subscription reminders, or other annoying interruptions.

**Solution:** An extension that uses a crowd-sourced database (like SponsorBlock) to automatically skip sponsored segments, intros, outros, and subscription reminders within YouTube videos.

**Target Users:** All YouTube users who want a cleaner, uninterrupted viewing experience.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.9/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 8/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Chrome Extension](./platforms/chrome-extension/)

## Revenue Model
Free (Donation-based).

## Revenue Potential
N/A.

## Development Time
3-4 days.

## Technical Complexity
3/10. The extension would query the SponsorBlock API with the current video ID. The API returns timestamps for different segment types (sponsor, intro, etc.). The extension's logic then simply uses the YouTube player API to automatically seek past these segments.

## Competition Level
Low. SponsorBlock is the dominant player and is open source. The idea here is not to compete, but to create a client for their existing, open API, perhaps with a different UI or additional features. This is a proven concept with a massive user base.

## Key Features
- Automatic Segment Skipping: Skips sponsored content, intros, outros, and other annoying segments.
- Customizable Categories: Users can choose which types of segments they want to skip.
- Easy Submission: A simple UI to allow users to submit new segments to the database, contributing to the community.
- Color-Coded Timeline: Visually indicates the different segments on the YouTube progress bar.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users, positive reviews, and community contributions (donations and segment submissions).

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
