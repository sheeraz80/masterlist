# DeFi Protocol Encyclopedia

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** The DeFi space is filled with thousands of protocols, each with its own risks, tokenomics, and mechanisms. It's incredibly difficult for users to research and compare them effectively.

**Solution:** A browser extension that acts as a "Wikipedia for DeFi." When browsing a DeFi protocol's website, it shows a sidebar with community-sourced, standardized information about the protocol, including its audit history, tokenomics, and a simple explanation of how it works.

**Target Users:** New and intermediate DeFi users, researchers, and investors.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 5.7/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 0/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Free (community-driven).

## Revenue Potential
N/A.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The extension would pull its data from a public, community-editable database (which could be hosted on a platform like GitHub). The extension itself is just a client that displays this data.

## Competition Level
Low. While some websites provide protocol lists, an in-browser, community-driven encyclopedia is a unique concept.

## Key Features
- Protocol Sidebar: Displays key information about the DeFi protocol of the site you're visiting.
- Standardized Data: Includes fields for audits, insurance, tokenomics, contract addresses, and team anonymity status.
- Community Contributions: A "Suggest an Edit" button that allows users to contribute new information or corrections via a GitHub pull request.
- Risk Ratings: A simple, community-voted risk score (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

## Success Indicators
Number of active users, number of community contributions, and becoming a trusted source for protocol information.

## Additional Information
- **Cross-platform Project:** No
- **Completeness Score:** 10/10
