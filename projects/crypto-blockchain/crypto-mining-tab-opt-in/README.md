# Crypto Mining Tab (Opt-in)

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Content creators and website owners struggle to monetize their traffic without resorting to intrusive ads. Some users would prefer an alternative way to support the sites they love.

**Solution:** A browser extension that allows users to opt-in to donate a small amount of their unused CPU power to mine privacy-focused cryptocurrencies (like Monero) for their favorite websites. The website owner would need to sign up for the service to receive the funds.

**Target Users:** Privacy-conscious users who dislike ads, and website owners looking for alternative monetization.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 7.2/10

### Score Breakdown
- **Completeness:** 10/10
- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 7/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 8/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Crypto Browser Tools](./platforms/crypto-browser-tools/)

## Revenue Model
Commission on mined funds.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $500/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $10,000/mo.

## Development Time
4-5 days.

## Technical Complexity
4/10. The extension would use a WebAssembly-based crypto miner. The core of the product is the user interface for managing consent and the backend for pooling and distributing the mined funds to website owners.

## Competition Level
Low. This was an idea explored by services like Coinhive years ago, but it failed due to non-consensual mining. A modern, privacy-focused, and 100% opt-in approach could succeed where previous attempts failed.

## Key Features
- User-Controlled Mining: Mining only happens on specific sites that the user has explicitly approved, with a clear visual indicator that it's active.
- CPU Throttling: Users can control how much of their CPU is used, ensuring it doesn't impact their computer's performance.
- Ad-Free Experience: If a user enables mining for a partner site, the extension could also block ads on that site, providing a direct benefit.
- Dashboard for Creators: Website owners get a simple dashboard to see how much they've earned.

## Success Indicators
Number of active users, number of partner websites, and total value of crypto mined and distributed.
