## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. This was an idea explored by services like Coinhive years ago, but it failed due to non-consensual mining. A modern, privacy-focused, and 100% opt-in approach could succeed where previous attempts failed.

Acquisition: Partner with content creators and publishers who have a strong community and are looking for new revenue streams.
