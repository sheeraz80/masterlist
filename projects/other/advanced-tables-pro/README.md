# Advanced Tables Pro

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** While Obsidian's Advanced Tables plugin is a must-have for working with Markdown tables, it still lacks features found in spreadsheet software, like cell merging, sorting, and more complex formulas.

**Solution:** A plugin that supercharges Markdown tables, adding spreadsheet-like functionality directly within the Obsidian editor.

**Target Users:** All Obsidian users who work with tabular data, from project managers to researchers.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.4/10

### Score Breakdown

- **Revenue Potential:** 6/10
- **Technical Feasibility:** 5/10
- **Market Opportunity:** 6/10
- **Platform Coverage:** 2/10

## Platforms
This project can be implemented on the following platforms:
- [Obsidian Plugin](./platforms/obsidian-plugin/)

## Revenue Model
One-Time Purchase.

## Revenue Potential
Conservative: $600/mo; Realistic: $3,000/mo; Optimistic: $8,000/mo.

## Development Time


## Technical Complexity
6/10. This is a complex editor extension. It would require significant DOM manipulation to create a spreadsheet-like UI on top of a standard Markdown table, and a custom formula engine in JavaScript.

## Competition Level
Medium. The base Advanced Tables plugin is free and popular. This "Pro" version must offer significant new functionality to justify a price.

## Key Features
- Visual Table Editor: A WYSIWYG editor for tables that supports cell merging, resizing, and styling.
- Advanced Formulas: A formula system that goes beyond simple sums, including functions like AVERAGE, IF, and VLOOKUP (within the same table).
- Column Sorting: Click on a column header to sort the table by that column's values.
- CSV Import/Export: Easily import data from a CSV file into a table, or export a table to CSV.
- Conditional Formatting: Automatically change a cell's background color based on its value (e.g., highlight low numbers in red).

## Success Indicators
Total sales volume and becoming the standard for advanced data work in Obsidian.
