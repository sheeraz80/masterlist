# Vault Health Check

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** Over time, an Obsidian vault can become messy with broken links, orphaned attachments, and inconsistent tagging. Manually cleaning this up is a tedious chore that most users neglect.

**Solution:** A "janitor" plugin that scans the entire vault and generates a report of potential issues, with one-click buttons to fix them.

**Target Users:** All Obsidian users, especially those with large, long-standing vaults.

## Quality Score
**Overall Score:** 6.4/10

### Score Breakdown
