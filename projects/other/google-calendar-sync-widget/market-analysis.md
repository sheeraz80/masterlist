# Google Calendar Sync Widget - Market Analysis

## Market Overview

### Problem Size
One of Notion's most requested features is a true two-way sync with Google Calendar. While users can embed a read-only view of their calendar, they cannot create or edit events from within Notion.

### Target Market
All Notion users, particularly those who use it for task and project management.

## Competition Analysis

### Competition Level
**Rating:** Low. This is a technically difficult problem to solve, so few solutions exist. A reliable and well-designed widget would be extremely popular.

### Revenue Breakdown
- **Conservative:** 1,000/mo
- **Realistic:** 10,000/mo
- **Optimistic:** 40,000/mo

### Monetization Strategy
Strategy: A subscription model is appropriate for a tool that provides ongoing, high-value service and has server costs. Pricing: Pro Plan ($5/month). A free trial or a read-only free version could be offered. Acquisition: Target the entire Notion user base through social media, forums, and content marketing. This would be a "holy grail" widget for many.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk
Technical Risk: Building a reliable, bug-free two-way sync is very difficult. Handling authentication and API rate limits for thousands of users is a major challenge. Platform Risk: Notion could eventually build this feature natively, which would make the widget redundant.
