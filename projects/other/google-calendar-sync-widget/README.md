# Google Calendar Sync Widget

## Overview
**Problem Statement:** One of Notion's most requested features is a true two-way sync with Google Calendar. While users can embed a read-only view of their calendar, they cannot create or edit events from within Notion.

**Solution:** An embeddable widget that provides a fully interactive, two-way synced Google Calendar inside Notion. Users can create, edit, and drag-and-drop events, with all changes instantly reflected in their actual Google Calendar.

**Target Users:** All Notion users, particularly those who use it for task and project management.
